/* utility functions for handling locale-specific stuff like what
 * character represents the decimal point.
 *
 * All C programs have an underlying locale.  Perl code generally doesn't pay
 * any attention to it except within the scope of a 'use locale'.  For most
 * categories, it accomplishes this by just using different operations if it is
 * in such scope than if not.  However, various libc functions called by Perl
 * are affected by the LC_NUMERIC category, so there are macros in perl.h that
 * are used to toggle between the current locale and the C locale depending on
 * the desired behavior of those functions at the moment.  And, LC_MESSAGES is
 * switched to the C locale for outputting the message unless within the scope
 * of 'use locale'.
 *
 * There is more than the typical amount of variation between platforms with
 * regard to locale handling.  At the end of these introductory comments, are
 * listed various relevent Configuration options, including some that can be
 * used to pretend to some extent that this is being developed on a different
 * platform than it actually is.  This allows you to make changes and catch
 * some errors without having access to those other platforms.
 *
 * This code now has multi-thread-safe locale handling on systems that support
 * that.  This is completely transparent to most XS code.  On earlier systems,
 * it would be possible to emulate thread-safe locales, but this likely would
 * involve a lot of locale switching, and would require XS code changes.
 * Macros could be written so that the code wouldn't have to know which type of
 * system is being used.
 *
 * Table-driven code is used for simplicity and clarity, as many operations
 * differ only in which category is being worked on.  However the system
 * categories need not be small contiguous integers, so do not lend themselves
 * to table lookup.  Instead we have created our own equivalent values which
 * are all small contiguous non-negative integers, and translation functions
 * between the two sets.  For category 'LC_foo', the name of our index is
 * LC_foo_INDEX_.  Various parallel tables, indexed by these, are used for the
 * translation.  The tables are generated at compile-time based on platform
 * characteristics and Configure options.  They hide from the code many of the
 * vagaries of the different locale implementations out there.
 *
 * On unthreaded perls, most operations expand out to just the basic
 * setlocale() calls.  That sort of is true on threaded perls on modern Windows
 * systems where the same API, after set up, is used for thread-safe locale
 * handling.  (But there are complications on Windows due to internal character
 * set issues.)  On other systems, there is a completely different API,
 * specified in POSIX 2008, to do thread-safe locales.  On these systems, our
 * bool_setlocale_2008_i() function is used to hide the different API from the
 * outside.  This makes it completely transparent to most XS code.
 *
 * A huge complicating factor is that the LC_NUMERIC category is normally held
 * in the C locale, except during those relatively rare times when it needs to
 * be in the underlying locale.  There is a bunch of code to accomplish this,
 * and to allow easy switches from one state to the other.
 *
 * In addition, the setlocale equivalents have versions for the return context,
 * 'void' and 'bool', besides the full return value.  This can present
 * opportunities for avoiding work.  We don't have to necessarily create a safe
 * copy to return if no return is desired.
 *
 * There are 3.5 major implementations here; which one chosen depends on what
 * the platform has available, and Configuration options.
 *
 * 1) Raw posix_setlocale().  This implementation is basically the libc
 *    setlocale(), with possibly minor tweaks.  This is used for startup, and
 *    always for unthreaded perls, and when the API for safe locale threading
 *    is identical to the unsafe API (Windows, currently).
 *
 *    This implementation is composed of two layers:
 *      a)  posix_setlocale() implements the libc setlocale().  In most cases,
 *          it is just an alias for the libc version.  But Windows doesn't
 *          fully conform to the POSIX standard, and this is a layer on top of
 *          libc to bring it more into conformance.  And in Configurations
 *          where perl is to ignore some locale categories that the libc
 *          setlocale() knows about, there is a layer to cope with that.
 *      b)  stdized_setlocale() is a layer above a) that fixes some vagaries in
 *          the return value of the libc setlocale().  On most platforms this
 *          layer is empty; in order to be activated, it requires perl to be
 *          Configured with a parameter indicating the platform's defect.  The
 *          current ones are listed at the definition of the macro.
 *
 * 2) An implementation that adds a minimal layer above implementation 1),
 *    making that implementation uninterruptible and returning a
 *    per-thread/per-category value.
 *
 * 3a and 3b) An implementation of POSIX 2008 thread-safe locale handling,
 *    hiding from the programmer the completely different API for this.
 *    This automatically makes almost all code thread-safe without need for
 *    changes.  This implementation is chosen on threaded perls when the
 *    platform properly supports the POSIX 2008 functions, and when there is no
 *    manual override to the contrary passed to Configure.
 *
 *    3a) is when the platform has a documented reliable querylocale() function
 *        or equivalent that is selected to be used.
 *    3b) is when we have to emulate that functionality.
 *
 *    Unfortunately, it seems that some platforms that claim to support these
 *    are buggy, in one way or another.  There are workarounds encoded here,
 *    where feasible, for platforms where the bugs are amenable to that
 *    (glibc, for example).  But other platforms instead don't use this
 *    implementation.
 *
 * z/OS (os390) is an outlier.  Locales really don't work under threads when
 * either the radix character isn't a dot, or attempts are made to change
 * locales after the first thread is created.  The reason is that IBM has made
 * it thread-safe by refusing to change locales (returning failure if
 * attempted) any time after an application has called pthread_create() to
 * create another thread.  The expectation is that an application will set up
 * its locale information before the first fork, and be stable thereafter.  But
 * perl toggles LC_NUMERIC if the locale's radix character isn't a dot, as do
 * the other toggles, which are less common.
 *
 * Associated with each implementation are three sets of macros that translate
 * a consistent API into what that implementation needs.  Each set consists of
 * three macros with the suffixes:
 *  _c  Means the argument is a locale category number known at compile time.
 *          An example would be LC_TIME.  This token is a compile-time constant
 *          and can be passed to a '_c' macro.
 *  _r  Means the argument is a locale category number whose value might not be
 *      known until runtime
 *  _i  Means the argument is our internal index of a locale category
 *
 * The three sets are:    ('_X'  means one of '_c', '_r', '_i')
 * 1) bool_setlocale_X()
 *      This calls the appropriate setlocale()-equivalent for the
 *      implementation, with the category and new locale.  The input locale is
 *      not necessarily valid, so the return is true or false depending on
 *      whether or not the setlocale() succeeded.  This is not used for
 *      querying the locale, so the input locale must not be NULL.
 *
 *      This macro is suitable for toggling the locale back and forth during an
 *      operation.  For example, the names of days and months under LC_TIME are
 *      strings that are also subject to LC_CTYPE.  If the locales of these two
 *      categories differ, mojibake can result on many platforms.  The code
 *      here will toggle LC_CTYPE into the locale of LC_TIME temporarily to
 *      avoid this.
 *
 *      Several categories require extra work when their locale is changed.
 *      LC_CTYPE, for example, requires the calculation of the table of which
 *      characters fold to which others under /i pattern matching or fc(), as
 *      folding is not a concept in POSIX.  This table isn't needed when the
 *      LC_CTYPE locale gets toggled during an operation, and will be toggled
 *      back before return to the caller.  To save work that would be
 *      discarded, the bool_setlocale_X() implementations don't do this extra
 *      work.  Instead, there is a separate function for just this purpose to
 *      be done before control is transferred back to the external caller.  All
 *      categories that have such requirements have such a function.  The
 *      update_functions[] array contains pointers to them (or NULL for
 *      categories which don't need a function).
 *
 *      Care must be taken to remember to call the separate function before
 *      returning to an external caller, and to not use things it updates
 *      before its call.  An alternative approach would be to have
 *      bool_setlocale_X() always call the update, which would return
 *      immediately if a flag wasn't set indicating it was time to actually
 *      perform it.
 *
 * 2) void_setlocale_X()
 *      This is like bool_setlocale_X(), but it is used only when it is
 *      expected that the call must succeed, or something is seriously wrong.
 *      A panic is issued if it fails.  The caller uses this form when it just
 *      wants to assume things worked.
 *
 * 3) querylocale_X()
 *      This returns a string that specifies the current locale for the given
 *      category given by the input argument.  The string is safe from other
 *      threads zapping it, and the caller need not worry about freeing it, but
 *      it may be mortalized, so must be copied if you need to preserve it
 *      across calls, or long term.  This returns the actual current locale,
 *      not the nominal.  These differ, for example, when LC_NUMERIC is
 *      supposed to be a locale whose decimal radix character is a comma.  As
 *      mentioned above, Perl actually keeps this category set to C in such
 *      circumstances so that XS code can just assume a dot radix character.
 *      querylocale_X() returns the locale that libc has stored at this moment,
 *      so most of the time will return a locale whose radix character is a
 *      dot.  The macro query_nominal_locale_i() can be used to get the nominal
 *      locale that an external caller would expect, for all categories except
 *      LC_ALL.  For that, you can use the function
 *      S_calculate_LC_ALL_string().  Or S_native_querylocale_i() will operate
 *      on any category.
 *
 * The underlying C API that this implements uses category numbers, hence the
 * code is structured to use '_r' at the API level to convert to indexes, which
 * are then used internally with the '_i' forms.
 *
 * The splitting apart into setting vs querying means that the return value of
 * the bool macros is not subject to potential clashes with other threads,
 * eliminating any need for the calling code to worry about that and get it
 * wrong.  Whereas, you do have to think about thread interactions when using a
 * query.
 *
 * Additionally, for the implementations where there aren't any complications,
 * a setlocale_i() is defined that is like plain setlocale(), returning the new
 * locale.  Thus it combines a bool_setlocale_X() with a querylocale_X().  It
 * is used only for performance on implementations that allow it, such as
 * non-threaded perls.
 *
 * There are also a few other macros herein that use this naming convention to
 * describe their category parameter.
 *
 * Relevant Configure options
 *
 *      -Accflags=-DNO_LOCALE
 *          This compiles perl to always use the C locale, ignoring any
 *          attempts to change it.  This could be useful on platforms with a
 *          crippled locale implementation.
 *
 *      -Accflags=-DNO_THREAD_SAFE_LOCALE
 *          Even if thread-safe operations are available on this platform and
 *          would otherwise be used (because this is a perl with multiplicity),
 *          perl is compiled to not use them.  This could be useful on
 *          platforms where the libc is buggy.
 *
 *      -Accflags=-DNO_POSIX_2008_LOCALE
 *          Even if the libc locale operations specified by the Posix 2008
 *          Standard are available on this platform and would otherwise be used
 *          (because this is a perl with multiplicity), perl is compiled to not
 *          use them.  This could be useful on platforms where the libc is
 *          buggy.  This is like NO_THREAD_SAFE_LOCALE, but has no effect on
 *          platforms that don't have these functions.
 *
 *      -Accflags=-DUSE_POSIX_2008_LOCALE
 *          Normally, setlocale() is used for locale operations on perls
 *          compiled without multiplicity.  This option causes the locale
 *          operations defined by the Posix 2008 Standard to always be used
 *          instead.  This could be useful on platforms where the libc
 *          setlocale() is buggy.
 *
 *      -Accflags=-DNO_THREAD_SAFE_QUERYLOCALE
 *          This applies only to platforms that have a querylocale() libc
 *          function.  perl assumes that that function is thread-safe, unless
 *          overridden by this, typically in a hints file.  When overridden,
 *          querylocale() is called only while the locale mutex is locked, and
 *          the result is copied to a per-thread place before unlocking.
 *
 *      -Accflags=-DUSE_NL_LOCALE_NAME
 *          glibc has an undocumented equivalent function to querylocale().  It
 *          currently isn't used by default because it is undocumented.  But
 *          testing hasn't found any problems with it.  Using this Configure
 *          option enables it on systems that have it (with no effect on
 *          systems lacking it).  Enabling this removes the need for perl
 *          to keep its own records, hence is more efficient and guaranteed to
 *          be accurate.
 *
 *      -Accflags=-DNO_LOCALE_CTYPE
 *      -Accflags=-DNO_LOCALE_NUMERIC
 *          etc.
 *
 *          If the named category(ies) does(do) not exist on this platform,
 *          these have no effect.  Otherwise they cause perl to be compiled to
 *          always keep the named category(ies) in the C locale.
 *
 *      -Accflags=-DHAS_BROKEN_SETLOCALE_QUERY_LC_ALL
 *          This would be set in a hints file to tell perl that doing a libc
 *              setlocale(LC_ALL, NULL)
 *          can give erroneous results, and perl will compensate to get the
 *          correct results.  This is known to be a problem in earlier AIX
 *          versions
 *
 *      -Accflags=-DHAS_LF_IN_SETLOCALE_RETURN
 *          This would be set in a hints file to tell perl that a libc
 *          setlocale() can return results containing \n characters that need
 *          to be stripped off.  khw believes there aren't any such platforms
 *          still in existence.
 *
 *      -Accflags=-DLIBC_HANDLES_MISMATCHED_CTYPE
 *          Consider the name of a month in some language, Chinese for example.
 *          If LC_TIME has been set to a Chinese locale, strftime() can be used
 *          to generate the Chinese month name for any given date, by using the
 *          %B format.  But also suppose that LC_CTYPE is set to, say, "C".
 *          The return from strftime() on many platforms will be mojibake given
 *          that no Chinese month name is composed of just ASCII characters.
 *          Perl handles this for you by automatically toggling LC_CTYPE to
 *          whatever LC_TIME is during the execution of strftime(), and
 *          afterwards restoring it to its prior value.  But the strftime()
 *          (and similar functions) in some libc implementations already do
 *          this toggle, meaning perl's action is redundant.  You can tell perl
 *          that a libc does this by setting this Configure option, and it will
 *          skip its syncing LC_CTYPE and whatever the other locale is.
 *          Currently, perl ignores this Configuration option and  syncs anyway
 *          for LC_COLLATE-related operations, due to perl's internal needs.
 *
 *      -Accflags=USE_FAKE_LC_ALL_POSITIONAL_NOTATION
 *          This is used when developing Perl on a platform that uses
 *          'name=value;' notation to represent LC_ALL when not all categories
 *          are the same.  When so compiled, much of the code gets compiled
 *          and exercised that applies to platforms that instead use positional
 *          notation.  This allows for finding many bugs in that portion of the
 *          implementation, without having to access such a platform.
 *
 *      -Accflags=-DWIN32_USE_FAKE_OLD_MINGW_LOCALES
 *          This is used when developing Perl on a non-Windows platform to
 *          compile and exercise much of the locale-related code that instead
 *          applies to MingW platforms that don't use the more modern UCRT
 *          library.  This allows for finding many bugs in that portion of the
 *          implementation, without having to access such a platform.

     * the responsibility of the caller to make sure gets freed
     *
     * The locale for each category is independent of the other categories.
     * Often, they are all the same, but certainly not always.  Perl, in fact,
     * usually keeps LC_NUMERIC in the C locale, regardless of the underlying
     * locale.  LC_ALL has to be able to represent the case of when not all
     * categories have the same locale.  Platforms have differing ways of
     * representing this.  Internally, this file uses the 'name=value;'
     * representation found on some platforms, so this function always looks
     * for and parses that.  Other platforms use a positional notation.  On
     * those platforms, this function also parses that form.  It examines the
     * input to see which form is being parsed.
     *
     * Often, all categories will have the same locale.  This is special cased
     * if 'always_use_full_array' is false on input:
     *      1) If the input 'string' is a single value, this function doesn't
     *         store anything into 'output', and returns 'no_array'
     *      2) Some platforms will return multiple occurrences of the same
     *         value rather than coalescing them down to a single one.  HP-UX
     *         is such a one.  This function will do that collapsing for you,
     *         returning 'only_element_0' and saving the single value in
     *         output[0], which the caller will need to arrange to be freed.
     *         The rest of output[] is undefined, and does not need to be
     *         freed.
     *
     * Otherwise, the input 'string' may not be valid.  This function looks
     * mainly for syntactic errors, and if found, returns 'invalid'.  'output'
     * will not be filled in in that case, but the input state of it isn't
     * necessarily preserved.  Turning on -DL debugging will give details as to
     * the error.  If 'panic_on_error' is 'true', the function panics instead
     * of returning on error, with a message giving the details.
     *
     * Otherwise, output[] will be filled with the individual locale names for
     * all categories on the system, 'full_array' will be returned, and the
     * caller needs to arrange for each to be freed.  This means that either at
     * least one category differed from the others, or 'always_use_full_array' was
     * true on input.
     *
     * perl may be configured to ignore changes to a category's locale to
     * non-C.  The parameter 'override' tells this function what to do when
     * encountering such an illegal combination:
     *
     *      no_override             indicates to take no special action
     *      override_if_ignored,    indicates to return 'C' instead of what the
     *                              input string actually says.
     *      check_that_overridden   indicates to panic if the string says the
     *                              category is not 'C'.  This is used when
     *                              non-C is very unexpected behavior.

 * ==========================================================================
 *
 * The next many lines form several implementations of a layer above the
 * close-to-the-metal 'posix' and 'stdized' macros.  They are used to present a
 * uniform API to the rest of the code in this file in spite of the disparate
 * underlying implementations.  Which implementation gets compiled depends on
 * the platform capabilities (and some user choice) as determined by Configure.
 *
 * As more fully described in the introductory comments in this file, the
 * API of each implementation consists of three sets of macros.  Each set has
 * three variants with suffixes '_c', '_r', and '_i'.  In the list below '_X'
 * is to be replaced by any of these suffixes.
 *
 * 1) bool_setlocale_X  attempts to set the given category's locale to the
 *                      given value, returning if it worked or not.
 * 2) void_setlocale_X  is like the corresponding bool_setlocale, but used when
 *                      success is the only sane outcome, so failure causes it
 *                      to panic.
 * 3) querylocale_X     to see what the given category's locale is
 *
 * 4) setlocale_i()     is defined only in those implementations where the bool
 *                      and query forms are essentially the same, and can be
 *                      combined to save CPU time.
 *
 * Each implementation below is separated by ==== lines, and includes bool,
 * void, and query macros.  The query macros are first, followed by any
 * functions needed to implement them.  Then come the bool, again followed by
 * any implementing functions  Then are the void macros; next is setlocale_i if
 * present on this implementation.  Finally are any helper functions.  The sets
 * in each implementation are separated by ---- lines.
 *
 * The returned strings from all the querylocale...() forms in all
 * implementations are thread-safe, and the caller should not free them,
 * but each may be a mortalized copy.  If you need something stable across
 * calls, you need to savepv() the result yourself.

     * POSIX 2008, for some sick reason, chose not to provide a method to find
     * the category name of a locale, disregarding a basic linguistic tenet
     * that for any object, people will create a name for it.  (The next
     * version of the POSIX standard is proposed to fix this.)  Some vendors
     * have created a querylocale() function to do this in the meantime.  On
     * systems without querylocale(), we have to keep track of what the locale
     * has been set to, so that we can return its name so as to emulate
     * setlocale().  There are potential problems with this:
     *
     *  1)  We don't know what calling newlocale() with the locale argument ""
     *      actually does.  It gets its values from the program's environment.
     *      find_locale_from_environment() is used to work around this.  But it
     *      isn't fool-proof.  See the comments for that function for details.
     *  2)  It's possible for C code in some library to change the locale
     *      without us knowing it, and thus our records become wrong;
     *      querylocale() would catch this.  But as of September 2017, there
     *      are no occurrences in CPAN of uselocale().  Some libraries do use
     *      setlocale(), but that changes the global locale, and threads using
     *      per-thread locales will just ignore those changes.
     *  3)  Many systems have multiple names for the same locale.  Generally,
     *      there is an underlying base name, with aliases that evaluate to it.
     *      On some systems, if you set the locale to an alias, and then
     *      retrieve the name, you get the alias as expected; but on others you
     *      get the base name, not the alias you used.  And sometimes the
     *      charade is incomplete.  See
     *      https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=269375.
     *
     *      The code is structured so that the returned locale name when the
     *      locale is changed is whatever the result of querylocale() on the
     *      new locale is.  This effectively gives the result the system
     *      expects.  Without querylocale, the name returned is always the
     *      input name.  Theoretically this could cause problems, but khw knows
     *      of none so far, but mentions it here in case you are trying to
     *      debug something.  (This could be worked around by messing with the
     *      global locale temporarily, using setlocale() to get the base name;
     *      but that could cause a race.  The comments for
     *      find_locale_from_environment() give details on the potential race.)

     * This function calculates a string that defines the locale(s) LC_ALL is
     * set to, in either:
     *  1)  Our internal format if 'format' is set to INTERNAL_FORMAT.
     *  2)  The external format returned by Perl_setlocale() if 'format' is set
     *      to EXTERNAL_FORMAT_FOR_QUERY or EXTERNAL_FORMAT_FOR_SET.
     *
     *      These two are distinguished by:
     *       a) EXTERNAL_FORMAT_FOR_SET returns the actual locale currently in
     *          effect.
     *       b) EXTERNAL_FORMAT_FOR_QUERY returns the nominal locale.
     *          Currently this can differ only from the actual locale in the
     *          LC_NUMERIC category when it is set to a locale whose radix is
     *          not a dot.  (The actual locale is kept as a dot to accommodate
     *          the large corpus of XS code that expects it to be that;
     *          switched to a non-dot temporarily during certain operations
     *          that require the actual radix.)
     *
     * In both 1) and 2), LC_ALL's values are passed to this function by
     * 'category_locales_list' which is either:
     *  1) a pointer to an array of strings with up-to-date values of all the
     *     individual categories; or
     *  2) NULL, to indicate to use querylocale_i() to get each individual
     *     value.
     *
     * The caller sets 'returning' to
     *      WANT_TEMP_PV        the function returns the calculated string
     *                              as a mortalized temporary, so the caller
     *                              doesn't have to worry about it being
     *                              per-thread, nor needs to arrange for its
     *                              clean-up.
     *      WANT_PL_setlocale_buf  the function stores the calculated string
     *                              into the per-thread buffer PL_setlocale_buf
     *                              and returns a pointer to that.  The buffer
     *                              is cleaned up automatically in process
     *                              destruction.  This return method avoids
     *                              extra copies in some circumstances.
     *      WANT_VOID           NULL is returned.  This is used when the
     *                              function is being called only for its side

     *
     * querylocale(), on systems that have it, doesn't tend to work for LC_ALL.
     * So we have to construct the answer ourselves based on the passed in
     * data.
     *
     * If all individual categories are the same locale, we can just set LC_ALL
     * to that locale.  But if not, we have to create an aggregation of all the
     * categories on the system.  Platforms differ as to the syntax they use
     * for these non-uniform locales for LC_ALL.  Some, like glibc and Windows,
     * use an unordered series of name=value pairs, like
     *      LC_NUMERIC=C;LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8;...
     * to specify LC_ALL; others, like *BSD, use a positional notation with a
     * delimitter, typically a single '/' character:
     *      C/en_UK.UTF-8/...
     *
     * When the external format is desired, this function returns whatever the
     * system expects.  The internal format is always name=value pairs.
     *
     * For systems that have categories we don't know about, the algorithm
     * below won't know about those missing categories, leading to potential
     * bugs for code that looks at them.  If there is an environment variable
     * that sets that category, we won't know to look for it, and so our use of
     * LANG or "C" improperly overrides it.  On the other hand, if we don't do
     * what is done here, and there is no environment variable, the category's
     * locale should be set to LANG or "C".  So there is no good solution.  khw
     * thinks the best is to make sure we have a complete list of possible
     * categories, adding new ones as they show up on obscure platforms.

    /* NB: This function may actually change the locale on Windows.  It
     * currently is designed to be called only from setting the locale on
     * Windows, and POSIX 2008
     *
     * This function returns the locale specified by the program's environment
     * for the category specified by our internal index number 'index'.  It
     * therefore simulates:
     *      setlocale(cat, "")
     * but, except for some cases in Windows, doesn't actually change the
     * locale; merely returns it.
     *
     * The return need not be freed by the caller.  This
     * promise relies on PerlEnv_getenv() returning a mortalized copy to us.
     *
     * The simulation is needed only on certain platforms; otherwise, libc is
     * called with "" to get the actual value(s).  The simulation is needed
     * for:
     *
     *  1)  On Windows systems, the concept of the POSIX ordering of
     *      environment variables is missing.  To increase portability of
     *      programs across platforms, the POSIX ordering is emulated on
     *      Windows.
     *
     *  2)  On POSIX 2008 systems without querylocale(), it is problematic
     *      getting the results of the POSIX 2008 equivalent of
     *
     *          setlocale(category, "")
     *
     *      To ensure that we know exactly what those values are, we do the
     *      setting ourselves, using the documented algorithm specified by the
     *      POSIX standard (assuming the platform follows the Standard) rather
     *      than use "" as the locale.  This will lead to results that differ
     *      from native behavior if the native behavior differs from the
     *      Standard's documented value, but khw believes it is better to know
     *      what's going on, even if different from native, than to just guess.
     *
     *      glibc systems differ from this standard in having a LANGUAGE
     *      environment variable used for just LC_MESSAGES.  This function does
     *      NOT handle that.
     *
     *      Another option for the POSIX 2008 case would be, in a critical
     *      section, to save the global locale's current value, and do a
     *      straight setlocale(LC_ALL, "").  That would return our desired
     *      values, destroying the global locale's, which we would then
     *      restore.  But that could cause races with any other thread that is
     *      using the global locale and isn't using the mutex.  And, the only
     *      reason someone would have done that is because they are calling a
     *      library function, like in gtk, that calls setlocale(), and which
     *      can't be changed to use the mutex.  That wouldn't be a problem if
     *      this were to be done before any threads had switched, say during
     *      perl construction time.  But this code would still be needed for
     *      the general case.
     *
     * The Windows and POSIX 2008 differ in that the ultimate fallback is "C"
     * in POSIX, and is the system default locale in Windows.  To get that
     * system default value, we actually have to call setlocale() on Windows.

     *                  C locale are indistinguishable for the purposes of

=for apidoc Perl_setlocale

This is an (almost) drop-in replacement for the system L<C<setlocale(3)>>,
taking the same parameters, and returning the same information, except that it
returns the correct underlying C<LC_NUMERIC> locale.  Regular C<setlocale> will
instead return C<C> if the underlying locale has a non-dot decimal point
character, or a non-empty thousands separator for displaying floating point
numbers.  This is because perl keeps that locale category such that it has a
dot and empty separator, changing the locale briefly during the operations
where the underlying one is required. C<Perl_setlocale> knows about this, and
compensates; regular C<setlocale> doesn't.

Another reason it isn't completely a drop-in replacement is that it is
declared to return S<C<const char *>>, whereas the system setlocale omits the
C<const> (presumably because its API was specified long ago, and can't be
updated; it is illegal to change the information C<setlocale> returns; doing
so leads to segfaults.)

Finally, C<Perl_setlocale> works under all circumstances, whereas plain
C<setlocale> can be completely ineffective on some platforms under some
configurations.

Changing the locale is not a good idea when more than one thread is running,
except on systems where the predefined variable C<${^SAFE_LOCALES}> is
non-zero.  This is because on such systems the locale is global to the whole
process and not local to just the thread calling the function.  So changing it
in one thread instantaneously changes it in all.  On some such systems, the
system C<setlocale()> is ineffective, returning the wrong information, and
failing to actually change the locale.  z/OS refuses to try to change the
locale once a second thread is created.  C<Perl_setlocale>, should give you
accurate results of what actually happened on these problematic platforms,
returning NULL if the system forbade the locale change.

The return points to a per-thread static buffer, which is overwritten the next
time C<Perl_setlocale> is called from the same thread.

=for apidoc      Perl_langinfo
=for apidoc_item Perl_langinfo8

C<Perl_langinfo> is an (almost) drop-in replacement for the system
C<L<nl_langinfo(3)>>, taking the same C<item> parameter values, and returning
the same information.  But it is more thread-safe than regular
C<nl_langinfo()>, and hides the quirks of Perl's locale handling from your
code, and can be used on systems that lack a native C<nl_langinfo>.

However, you should instead use the improved version of this:
L</Perl_langinfo8>, which behaves identically except for an additional
parameter, a pointer to a variable declared as L</C<utf8ness_t>>, into which it
returns to you how you should treat the returned string with regards to it
being encoded in UTF-8 or not.

Concerning the differences between these and plain C<nl_langinfo()>:

=over

=item a.

C<Perl_langinfo8> has an extra parameter, described above.  Besides this, the
other reason they aren't quite a drop-in replacement is actually an advantage.
The C<const>ness of the return allows the compiler to catch attempts to write
into the returned buffer, which is illegal and could cause run-time crashes.

=item b.

They deliver the correct results for the C<RADIXCHAR> and C<THOUSEP> items,
without you having to write extra code.  The reason for the extra code would be
because these are from the C<LC_NUMERIC> locale category, which is normally
kept set by Perl so that the radix is a dot, and the separator is the empty
string, no matter what the underlying locale is supposed to be, and so to get
the expected results, you have to temporarily toggle into the underlying
locale, and later toggle back.  (You could use plain C<nl_langinfo> and
C<L</STORE_LC_NUMERIC_FORCE_TO_UNDERLYING>> for this but then you wouldn't get
the other advantages of C<Perl_langinfo()>; not keeping C<LC_NUMERIC> in the C
(or equivalent) locale would break a lot of CPAN, which is expecting the radix
(decimal point) character to be a dot.)

=item c.

The system function they replace can have its static return buffer trashed,
not only by a subsequent call to that function, but by a C<freelocale>,
C<setlocale>, or other locale change.  The returned buffer of these functions
is not changed until the next call to one or the other, so the buffer is never
in a trashed state.

=item d.

The return buffer is per-thread, so it also is never overwritten by a call to
these functions from another thread;  unlike the function it replaces.

=item e.

But most importantly, they work on systems that don't have C<nl_langinfo>, such
as Windows, hence making your code more portable.  Of the fifty-some possible
items specified by the POSIX 2008 standard,
L<http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/langinfo.h.html>,
only one is completely unimplemented, though on non-Windows platforms, another
significant one is not fully implemented).  They use various techniques to
recover the other items, including calling C<L<localeconv(3)>>, and
C<L<strftime(3)>>, both of which are specified in C89, so should be always be
available.  Later C<strftime()> versions have additional capabilities.
If an item is not available on your system, this returns either the value
associated with the C locale, or simply C<"">, whichever is more appropriate.

It is important to note that, when called with an item that is recovered by
using C<localeconv>, the buffer from any previous explicit call to
C<L<localeconv(3)>> will be overwritten.  But you shouldn't be using
C<localeconv> anyway because it is is very much not thread-safe, and suffers
from the same problems outlined in item 'b.' above for the fields it returns
that are controlled by the LC_NUMERIC locale category.  Instead, avoid all of
those problems by calling L</Perl_localeconv>, which is thread-safe; or by
using the methods given in L<perlcall>  to call
L<C<POSIX::localeconv()>|POSIX/localeconv>, which is also thread-safe.

=back

The details for those items which may deviate from what this emulation returns
and what a native C<nl_langinfo()> would return are specified in
L<I18N::Langinfo>.

When using C<Perl_langinfo8> (or plain C<Perl_langinfo>) on systems that don't
have a native C<nl_langinfo()>, you must

 #include "perl_langinfo.h"

before the C<perl.h> C<#include>.  You can replace your F<langinfo.h>
C<#include> with this one.  (Doing it this way keeps out the symbols that plain
F<langinfo.h> would try to import into the namespace for code that doesn't need
it.)

These implement the libc strftime(), but with a different API so that the return
value is a pointer to the formatted result (which MUST be arranged to be FREED
BY THE CALLER).  This allows these functions to increase the buffer size as
needed, so that the caller doesn't have to worry about that.

On failure they return NULL, and set errno to C<EINVAL>.

C<sv_strftime_tm> and C<sv_strftime_ints> are preferred, as they transparently
handle the UTF-8ness of the current locale, the input C<fmt>, and the returned
result.  Only if the current C<LC_TIME> locale is a UTF-8 one (and S<C<use
bytes>> is not in effect) will the result be marked as UTF-8.  These differ
only in the form of their inputs.  C<sv_strftime_tm> takes a filled-in
S<C<struct tm>> parameter.  C<sv_strftime_ints> takes a bunch of integer
parameters that together completely define a given time.

C<my_strftime> is kept for backwards compatibility.  Knowing if its result
should be considered UTF-8 or not requires significant extra logic.

Note that C<yday> and C<wday> effectively are ignored by C<sv_strftime_ints>
and C<my_strftime>, as mini_mktime() overwrites them

Also note that all three functions are always executed in the underlying
C<LC_TIME> locale of the program, giving results based on that locale.

     * This routine effectively does the following in most cases:
     *
     *      basic initialization;
     *      asserts that the compiled tables are consistent;
     *      initialize data structures;
     *      make sure we are in the global locale;
     *      setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
     *      switch to per-thread locale if applicable;
     *
     * The "" causes the locale to be set to what the environment variables at
     * the time say it should be.
     *
     * To handle possible failures, the setlocale is expanded to be like:
     *
     *      trial_locale = pre-first-trial;
     *      while (has_another_trial()) {
     *          trial_locale = next_trial();
     *          if setlocale(LC_ALL, trial_locale) {
     *              ok = true;
     *              break;

     *          if (! ok) warn_still_more();
     *      }
     *
     * The first trial is either:
     *      ""      to examine the environment variables for the locale
     *      NULL    to use the values already set for the locale by the program
     *              embedding this perl instantiation.
     *
     * Something is wrong if this trial fails, but there is a sequence of
     * fallbacks to try should that happen.  They are given in the enum below.

     * If there is no LC_ALL defined on the system, the setlocale() above is
     * replaced by a loop setting each individual category separately.
     *
     * In a non-embeded environment, this code is executed exactly once.  It
     * sets up the global locale environment.  At the end, if some sort of
     * thread-safety is in effect, it will turn thread 0 into using that, with
     * the same locale as the global initially.  thread 0 can then change its
     * locale at will without affecting the global one.
     *
     * At destruction time, thread 0 will revert to the global locale as the
     * other threads die.
     *
     * Care must be taken in an embedded environment.  This code will be
     * executed for each instantiation.  Since it changes the global locale, it
     * could clash with another running instantiation that isn't using
     * per-thread locales.  perlembed suggests having the controlling program
     * set each instantiation's locale and set PERL_SKIP_LOCALE_INIT so this
     * code uses that without actually changing anything.  Then the onus is on
     * the controlling program to prevent any races.  The code below does
     * enough locking so as to prevent system calls from overwriting data
     * before it is safely copied here, but that isn't a general solution.

    /* A locale collation definition includes primary, secondary, tertiary,
     * etc. weights for each character.  To sort, the primary weights are used,
     * and only if they compare equal, then the secondary weights are used, and
     * only if they compare equal, then the tertiary, etc.
     *
     * strxfrm() works by taking the input string, say ABC, and creating an
     * output transformed string consisting of first the primary weights,
     * A¹B¹C¹ followed by the secondary ones, A²B²C²; and then the tertiary,
     * etc, yielding A¹B¹C¹ A²B²C² A³B³C³ ....  Some characters may not have
     * weights at every level.  In our example, let's say B doesn't have a
     * tertiary weight, and A doesn't have a secondary weight.  The constructed
     * string is then going to be
     *  A¹B¹C¹ B²C² A³C³ ....
     * This has the desired effect that strcmp() will look at the secondary or
     * tertiary weights only if the strings compare equal at all higher
     * priority weights.  The spaces shown here, like in
     *  "A¹B¹C¹ A²B²C² "
     * are not just for readability.  In the general case, these must actually
     * be bytes, which we will call here 'separator weights'; and they must be
     * smaller than any other weight value, but since these are C strings, only
     * the terminating one can be a NUL (some implementations may include a
     * non-NUL separator weight just before the NUL).  Implementations tend to
     * reserve 01 for the separator weights.  They are needed so that a shorter
     * string's secondary weights won't be misconstrued as primary weights of a
     * longer string, etc.  By making them smaller than any other weight, the
     * shorter string will sort first.  (Actually, if all secondary weights are
     * smaller than all primary ones, there is no need for a separator weight
     * between those two levels, etc.)
     *
     * The length of the transformed string is roughly a linear function of the
     * input string.  It's not exactly linear because some characters don't
     * have weights at all levels.  When we call strxfrm() we have to allocate
     * some memory to hold the transformed string.  The calculations below try
     * to find coefficients 'm' and 'b' for this locale so that m*x + b equals
     * how much space we need, given the size of the input string in 'x'.  If
     * we calculate too small, we increase the size as needed, and call
     * strxfrm() again, but it is better to get it right the first time to
     * avoid wasted expensive string transformations.
     *
     * We use the string below to find how long the transformation of it is.
     * Almost all locales are supersets of ASCII, or at least the ASCII
     * letters.  We use all of them, half upper half lower, because if we used
     * fewer, we might hit just the ones that are outliers in a particular
     * locale.  Most of the strings being collated will contain a preponderance
     * of letters, and even if they are above-ASCII, they are likely to have
     * the same number of weight levels as the ASCII ones.  It turns out that
     * digits tend to have fewer levels, and some punctuation has more, but
     * those are relatively sparse in text, and khw believes this gives a
     * reasonable result, but it could be changed if experience so dictates. */

 * LC_MESSAGES locale if in scope and we have that category; and LC_CTYPE if we
 * don't have LC_MESSAGES; and whatever strerror returns if we don't have
 * either category.
 *
 * There are two sets of implementations.  The first below is if we have
 * strerror_l().  This is the simpler.  We just use the already-built C locale
 * object if not in locale scope, or build up a custom one otherwise.
 *
 * When strerror_l() is not available, we may have to swap locales temporarily
 * to bring the two categories into sync with each other, and possibly to the C
 * locale.
 *
 * Because the prepropessing directives to conditionally compile this function

=for apidoc switch_to_global_locale

This function copies the locale state of the calling thread into the program's
global locale, and converts the thread to use that global locale.

It is intended so that Perl can safely be used with C libraries that access the
global locale and which can't be converted to not access it.  Effectively, this
means libraries that call C<L<setlocale(3)>> on non-Windows systems.  (For
portability, it is a good idea to use it on Windows as well.)

A downside of using it is that it disables the services that Perl provides to
hide locale gotchas from your code.  The service you most likely will miss
regards the radix character (decimal point) in floating point numbers.  Code
executed after this function is called can no longer just assume that this
character is correct for the current circumstances.

To return to Perl control, and restart the gotcha prevention services, call
C<L</sync_locale>>.  Behavior is undefined for any pure Perl code that executes
while the switch is in effect.

The global locale and the per-thread locales are independent.  As long as just
one thread converts to the global locale, everything works smoothly.  But if
more than one does, they can easily interfere with each other, and races are
likely.  On Windows systems prior to Visual Studio 15 (at which point Microsoft
fixed a bug), races can occur (even if only one thread has been converted to
the global locale), but only if you use the following operations:

=over

=item L<POSIX::localeconv|POSIX/localeconv>

=item L<I18N::Langinfo>, items C<CRNCYSTR> and C<THOUSEP>

=item L<perlapi/Perl_langinfo>, items C<CRNCYSTR> and C<THOUSEP>

=back

The first item is not fixable (except by upgrading to a later Visual Studio
release), but it would be possible to work around the latter two items by
having Perl change its algorithm for calculating these to use Windows API
functions (likely C<GetNumberFormat> and C<GetCurrencyFormat>); patches
welcome.

XS code should never call plain C<setlocale>, but should instead be converted
to either call L<C<Perl_setlocale>|perlapi/Perl_setlocale> (which is a drop-in
for the system C<setlocale>) or use the methods given in L<perlcall> to call
L<C<POSIX::setlocale>|POSIX/setlocale>.  Either one will transparently properly
handle all cases of single- vs multi-thread, POSIX 2008-supported or not.

=for apidoc sync_locale

This function copies the state of the program global locale into the calling
thread, and converts that thread to using per-thread locales, if it wasn't
already, and the platform supports them.  The LC_NUMERIC locale is toggled into
the standard state (using the C locale's conventions), if not within the
lexical scope of S<C<use locale>>.

Perl will now consider itself to have control of the locale.

Since unthreaded perls have only a global locale, this function is a no-op
without threads.

This function is intended for use with C libraries that do locale manipulation.
It allows Perl to accommodate the use of them.  Call this function before
transferring back to Perl space so that it knows what state the C code has left
things in.

XS code should not manipulate the locale on its own.  Instead,
L<C<Perl_setlocale>|perlapi/Perl_setlocale> can be used at any time to query or
change the locale (though changing the locale is antisocial and dangerous on
multi-threaded systems that don't have multi-thread safe locale operations.
(See L<perllocale/Multi-threaded operation>).

Using the libc L<C<setlocale(3)>> function should be avoided.  Nevertheless,
certain non-Perl libraries called from XS, do call it, and their behavior may
not be able to be changed.  This function, along with
C<L</switch_to_global_locale>>, can be used to get seamless behavior in these
circumstances, as long as only one thread is involved.

If the library has an option to turn off its locale manipulation, doing that is
preferable to using this mechanism.  C<Gtk> is such a library.

The return value is a boolean: TRUE if the global locale at the time of call
was in effect for the caller; and FALSE if a per-thread locale was in effect.

     * to follow along.  This routine does that based on per-interpreter
     * variables we keep just for this purpose.
     *
     * There are two implementations where this is an issue.  For the other
     * implementations, it doesn't matter because libc is using global values
     * that all threads know about.
     *
     * The two implementations are where libc keeps thread-specific information
     * on its own.  These are
     *
     * POSIX 2008:  The current locale is kept by libc as an object.  We save
     *              a copy of that in the per-thread PL_cur_locale_obj, and so
     *              this routine uses that copy to tell the thread it should be
     *              operating with that object
     * Windows thread-safe locales:  A given thread in Windows can be being run
     *              with per-thread locales, or not.  When the thread context
     *              changes, libc doesn't automatically know if the thread is
     *              using per-thread locales, nor does it know what the new
     *              thread's locale is.  We keep that information in the
     *              per-thread variables:
     *                  PL_controls_locale  indicates if this thread is using
     *                                      per-thread locales or not
     *                  PL_cur_LC_ALL       indicates what the locale should be
     *                                      if it is a per-thread locale.
