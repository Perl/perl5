/* This file contains the main Perl opcode execution loop. It just
 * calls the pp_foo() function associated with each op, and expects that
 * function to return a pointer to the next op to be executed, or null if
 * it's the end of the sub or program or whatever.
 *
 * There is a similar loop in dump.c, Perl_runops_debug(), which does
 * the same, but also checks for various debug flags each time round the
 * loop.
 *
 * Why this function requires a file all of its own is anybody's guess.
