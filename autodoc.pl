# The generated pod consists of sections of related elements, functions,
# macros, and variables.  The keys of %valid_sections give the current legal
# ones.  Just add a new key to add a section.
#
# Throughout the files read by this script are lines like
#
# =for apidoc_section Section Name
# =for apidoc_section $section_name_variable
#
# "Section Name" (after having been stripped of leading space) must be one of
# the legal section names, or an error is thrown.  $section_name_variable must
# be one of the legal section name variables defined below; these expand to
# legal section names.  This form is used so that minor wording changes in
# these titles can be confined to this file.  All the names of the variables
# end in '_scn'; this suffix is optional in the apidoc_section lines.
#
# All API elements defined between this line and the next 'apidoc_section'
# line will go into the section "Section Name" (or $section_name_variable),
# sorted by dictionary order within it.  perlintern and perlapi are parallel
# documents, each potentially with a section "Section Name".  Each element is
# marked as to which document it goes into.  If there are none for a
# particular section in perlapi, that section is omitted.
#
# Also, in .[ch] files, there may be
#
# =head1 Section Name
#
# lines in comments.  These are also used by this program to switch to section
# "Section Name".  The difference is that if there are any lines after the
# =head1, inside the same comment, and before any =for apidoc-ish lines, they
# are used as a heading for section "Section Name" (in both perlintern and
# perlapi).  This includes any =head[2-5].  If more than one '=head1 Section
# Name' line has content, they appear in the generated pod in an undefined
# order.  Note that you can't use a $section_name_variable in =head1 lines
#
# The next =head1, =for apidoc_section, or file end terminates what goes into
# the current section
#
# The %valid_sections hash below also can have header content, which will
# appear before any =head1 content.  The hash can also have footer content
# content, which will appear at the end of the section, after all the
# elements.
#
# The lines that define the actual functions, etc are documented in embed.fnc,
# because they have flags which must be kept in sync with that file.

            This is a list of those symbols that dont appear elsewhere in ths
            document that indicate if the current platform has a certain
            capability.  Their names all begin with C<HAS_>.  Only those
            symbols whose capability is directly derived from the name are
            listed here.  All others have their meaning expanded out elsewhere
            in this document.  This (relatively) compact list is because we
            think that the expansion would add little or no value and take up
            a lot of space (because there are so many).  If you think certain
            ones should be expanded, send email to
            L<perl5-porters\@perl.org|mailto:perl5-porters\@perl.org>.

            Each symbol here will be C<#define>d if and only if the platform
            has the capability.  If you need more detail, see the
            corresponding entry in F<$config_h>.  For convenience, the list is
            split so that the ones that indicate there is a reentrant version
            of a capability are listed separately

            __HAS_LIST__

            And, the reentrant capabilities:

            __HAS_R_LIST__

               use strnlen()

            This list contains symbols that indicate if certain C<#include>
            files are present on the platform.  If your code accesses the
            functionality that one of these is for, you will need to
            C<#include> it if the symbol on this list is C<#define>d.  For
            more detail, see the corresponding entry in F<$config_h>.

|=head1 NAME
|
|perlapi - autogenerated documentation for the perl public API
|
|=head1 DESCRIPTION
|X<Perl API> X<API> X<api>
|
|This file contains most of the documentation of the perl public API, as
|generated by F<embed.pl>.  Specifically, it is a listing of functions,
|macros, flags, and variables that may be used by extension writers.  Besides
|L<perlintern> and F<$config_h>, some items are listed here as being actually
|documented in another pod.
|
|L<At the end|/$undocumented_scn> is a list of functions which have yet
|to be documented.  Patches welcome!  The interfaces of these are subject to
|change without notice.
|
|Some of the functions documented here are consolidated so that a single entry
|serves for multiple functions which all do basically the same thing, but have
|some slight differences.  For example, one form might process magic, while
|another doesn't.  The name of each variation is listed at the top of the
|single entry.
|
|The names of all API functions begin with the prefix C<Perl_> so as to
|prevent any name collisions with your code.  But, unless
|C<-Accflags=-DPERL_NO_SHORT_NAMES> has been specified in compiling your code
|(see L<perlembed/Hiding Perl_>), synonymous macros are also available to you
|that don't have this prefix, and also hide from you the need (or not) to have
|a thread context parameter passed to the function.  Generally, code is easier
|to write and to read when the short form is used, so in practice that
|compilation flag is not used.  Not all functions have the short form; both
|are listed here when available.
|
|Anything not listed here or in the other mentioned pods is not part of the
|public API, and should not be used by extension writers at all.  For these
|reasons, blindly using functions listed in F<proto.h> is to be avoided when
|writing extensions.
|
|In Perl, unlike C, a string of characters may generally contain embedded
|C<NUL> characters.  Sometimes in the documentation a Perl string is referred
|to as a "buffer" to distinguish it from a C string, but sometimes they are
|both just referred to as strings.
|
|Note that all Perl API global variables must be referenced with the C<PL_>
|prefix.  Again, those not listed here are not to be used by extension writers,
|and may be changed or removed without notice; same with macros.
|Some macros are provided for compatibility with the older,
|unadorned names, but this support may be disabled in a future release.
|
|Perl was originally written to handle US-ASCII only (that is characters
|whose ordinal numbers are in the range 0 - 127).
|And documentation and comments may still use the term ASCII, when
|sometimes in fact the entire range from 0 - 255 is meant.
|
|The non-ASCII characters below 256 can have various meanings, depending on
|various things.  (See, most notably, L<perllocale>.)  But usually the whole
|range can be referred to as ISO-8859-1.  Often, the term "Latin-1" (or
|"Latin1") is used as an equivalent for ISO-8859-1.  But some people treat
|"Latin1" as referring just to the characters in the range 128 through 255, or
|sometimes from 160 through 255.
|This documentation uses "Latin1" and "Latin-1" to refer to all 256 characters.
|
|Note that Perl can be compiled and run under either ASCII or EBCDIC (See
|L<perlebcdic>).  Most of the documentation (and even comments in the code)
|ignore the EBCDIC possibility.
|For almost all purposes the differences are transparent.
|As an example, under EBCDIC,
|instead of UTF-8, UTF-EBCDIC is used to encode Unicode strings, and so
|whenever this documentation refers to C<utf8>
|(and variants of that name, including in function names),
|it also (essentially transparently) means C<UTF-EBCDIC>.
|But the ordinals of characters differ between ASCII, EBCDIC, and
|the UTF- encodings, and a string encoded in UTF-EBCDIC may occupy a different
|number of bytes than in UTF-8.
|
|The organization of this document is tentative and subject to change.
|Suggestions and patches welcome
|L<perl5-porters\@perl.org|mailto:perl5-porters\@perl.org>.
|
|The API elements are grouped by functionality into sections, as follows.
|Within sections the elements are ordered alphabetically, ignoring case, with
|non-leading underscores sorted first, and leading underscores and digits
|sorted last.

|The following functions have been flagged as part of the public
|API, but are currently undocumented.  Use them at your own risk,
|as the interfaces are subject to change.  Functions that are not
|listed in this document are not intended for public use, and
|should NOT be used under any circumstances.
|
|If you feel you need to use one of these functions, first send
|email to L<perl5-porters@perl.org|mailto:perl5-porters@perl.org>.
|It may be that there is a good reason for the function not being
|documented, and it should be removed from this list; or it may
|just be that no one has gotten around to documenting it.  In the
|latter case, you will be asked to submit a patch to document the
|function.  Once your patch is accepted, it will indicate that the
|interface is stable (unless it is explicitly marked otherwise) and
|usable by you.
