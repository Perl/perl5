             The "Change installation prefix, if necessary." code needs to use
             the ~ expanded prefix and installprefix in the substitution.
             
             [ 27485]
             The existing order of the checks for whether man1dir and man3dir were
             ' ' were obviously buggy, because they set installman[13]dir only for
             the next if block to set it again. Reordering removes that daftness.
             
             [ 27488]
             Refactor most of the cut & paste for setting prefix/prefixexp variables
             and the "Change installation prefix, if necessary" into a new
             "function" setprefixvar (which I assume will become Setprefixvar.U)
             How many platforms still have Bourne shells that can't do shell
             functions? Someone's going to say Irix?
             
             [ 27489]
             Split break out the installprefix code from setprefixvar, which allows
             the remaining 8 places to call the common prefix conversion code.
             
             [ 27490]
             First stab at rather shaky Configure support for relocatable @INC.
             Seems to be installing rather more that it's supposed to be.
             
             [ 27491]
             Somewhat less shaky relocatable @INC support. You can install things
             to the current location of the perl tree, move it, install more things,
             move it again, lather rinse repeat.
             Configure with -Duserelocatableinc
             
             [ 27513]
             Make the original versions of relocated paths available from
             %Config::Config with the prefix "raw_". Not sure if "raw_" is the
             best choice.
             
             [ 27603]
             make configpm only update Config.pm, Config_heavy.pl if changed.
             Should stop spurious rebuilding of extensions.
             Also add documentation and copyright to top of file.

             Simplify the implementation in ExtUtils::Packlist::read.

             Encode run-time relocation of file names in packlist with a relocate_as
             attribute. With this, unmodified instmodsh correctly verifies installed
             modules even after relocation.
             
             [ 28202]
             Take advantage of the bug that binexp ignores the Configure
             installprefix, by using initialinstalllocation rather than binexp
             to determine the #! line for installed scripts. This way they are at
             least correct initially for a relocatable @INC perl, rather than
             starting as .../../bin/perl

             3 calls to strlen() we can avoid.

             Eliminate duplicate strlen()s by explicitly calling it.
             Note two places for future audit with FIXME.

             Moving the 4 writes of PL_no_mem followed by exit(1) to a static
             function makes the object code slightly smaller.

             It helps to actually *remove* the now-superfluous strlen().

             CORE::require was always parsed as require().
             That's because require() isn't overridable at tokenizer-level
             like other overridable built-ins, but is handled by the optree
             builder. So, find a way to pass the information that require()
             was written as CORE::require() to Perl_ck_require. This is
             done by adding a new token type REQUIRE and by adding OPf_SPECIAL
             to OP_REQUIRE when it's saw as CORE::require in the program text.

             [ 26172]
             With -DPURFIY we change the flags so that everything is allocated
             directly. (Don't use arenas at all.) This seems a rather elegant way
             to simplify some of the code in sv.c by removing conditional
             compilation.

             Norman observed that a couple of macros could make the body defintion

             [ 27094]
             new_body_type doesn't need to subtract the offset, that's what
             new_body_allocated is for.

             Also, I think that we may have been "leaking" NV bodies in blead since

             We only need to zero new bodies for upgrades. sv_dup doesn't need to

             Making more_* return a pointer, and swapping to a ternary ?: in
             new_* seems to generate slightly terser object code.

             The if() clause is the wrong way round, so OOK can never be true in
             this case. Given that OOK is never undone, we could never have been
             correctly upgrading a PV with OOK to HV or AV. I believe that only
             SVt_NULL is the only type ever upgraded to HV or AV.
