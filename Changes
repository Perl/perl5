        Log: Introduce a cache for UTF-8 data: length and byte<->char offset
             mapping are stored in a new type of magic.  Speeds up length(),
             substr(), index(), rindex(), pos(), and some parts of s///.
             
             The speedup varies a lot (on the usual suspects: what is the
             access pattern of the data, compiler, CPU), but should be at
             least one order of magnitude, and getting to the same magnitude
             as byte string speeds, and in some cases  (length on unchanged data)
             even reaching the byte string speed.  On the other hand, in some
             cases (index) the byte speed is still faster by a factor of five
             or so, but the bottleneck there does not seem to be any more
             the byte<->char offset mapping (instead, the fbm_instr() speed).
             
             There is one cache slot for the length, and only two for the 
             byte<->char offset mapping (the first one for the start->offset,
             and the second for the offset->offset+length, when talking
             in substr() terms).

        Log: At least partially address [perl #10000] by speeding
             up both the ASCII case (by about 2-3%) and the UTF-8 case 
             (by about 45%).  The major trick is to avoid hitting the
             costly S_reginclass().  (Even before this patch the speedup
             since 5.8.0 was about 40-50%.)  After this the UTF-8 case is
             still about 30-60% slower than the ASCII case.  (Note that
             I'm unable to reproduce the 10-fold speed difference of the
             original bug report; I can see a factor of 2 or 3, but no more.)

             Fix perl bug #17920 : a case of parser coredump.
             The fix is to disable Perl_block_start and Perl_block_end
             when the yacc parser has encountered errors. This prevents
             corruption of the internal stack, at the expense of correctness,
             but this doesn't matter as the code is unparseable anyway.

             Copy perldelta as perl58delta, purge the perldelta.
             
             The 17639 required editing to talk about 5.8.1 instead of
             5.9.X; the 17644 required manual resolving since perldelta
             was a bit confused between three Perl versions.
