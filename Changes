	     [ 33486]
	     An unfortunate side-effect of Encode and Encode::Alias use'ing each
	     other, and Encode::Alias exporting functions into Encode for it to use
	     as methods, broke the loading of the find_alias() Encode method in some
	     cases since 5.10. Breaking the recursive inheritance fixes it.

	     Correct logic error in PerlIOStdio_close() - 0 is an acceptable value
	     from dup(), so it can't also be the "don't do anything later" value.
	     
	     [ 33492]
	     We need mutex protection in PerlIOStdio_close() for the duration of
	     holding our true love file handle open, to stop anything else
	     temporarily using it for a quick dup() fling, and then closing the
	     file handle underneath us.
	     I suspect that the lack of this protection was the cause of the threads
	     free.t and blocks.t failures on OS X on 5.8.x, where usefaststdio is
	     the default, and PerlIO is unable to "invalidate" the FILE *.
	     
	     [ 33498]
	     Change 33492 did not spread the protection wide enough. There were
	     still two more races to be lost.
	     1: The close() could still happen after the (premature) mutex release
	     allowed another thread to dup() to that file descriptor.
	     2: The initial dup() could happen whilst another thread was in the
	     mutex protected region, and had temporarily closed the file
	     descriptor.
	     Race conditions remain with any other thread that actually does I/O
	     during the execution of the mutex protected region (as noted in a
	     comment), and dup() failure is not handled gracefully (also noted).

	     Add a new function newSVpvn_flags(), which takes a third parameter of

	     There's no need to handle 'set' magic in the mX?PUSH macros.
	     The macros all create new mortals using sv_newmortal(), and those
	     cannot be magical. This is in contrary to the X?PUSH macros, which
	     operate on TARG, which can be magical.

	     For 5.8.8 and earlier, always call newCONSTSUB(), as the interpreter
	     doesn't support proxy constant subroutines. For all 5.8.x add a cast
	     to (char *) for the second argument to newCONSTSUB().

	     Use a new (clean) anonymous hash for each loop, rather than a hash in
	     the pad, as the latter can change internal state sufficiently to
	     confuse matters (even though in all cases it has no keys and from
	     Perl space is "measurably" identical).
	     
	     [ 32500]
	     Get APItest.xs compiling on 5.8.x by making the compilation of the
	     Perl_hv_common() test code conditional on the macro hv_common being
	     defined, and the refcounted_he code conditional on it being 5.9 or
	     later.
	     
	     [ 32501]
	     Hack round the fact that UNITCHECK is nothing special on 5.8.x by
	     conditionally creating a sub UNITCHECK(&);
	     
	     [ 32502]
	     UNITCHECK isn't anything special in 5.8.x, so don't run those tests.
	     
	     [ 32503]
	     Skip the op.t API test as it's not relevant to 5.8.x (%^H propagation).
	     Correct the expectations of hash.t and svsetsv.t for 5.8.x.
	     
	     [ 32507]
	     Test both dMY_CXT and dMY_CXT_INTERP.

	     Add perl5110delta, and change 5100delta so that it is no longer "the"
	     perldelta.
	     
	     well, the 5100delta change. But add 5101delta instead.
