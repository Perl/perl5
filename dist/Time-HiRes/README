Time::HiRes module: High resolution time, sleep, and alarm.

Implement usleep, ualarm, and gettimeofday for Perl, as well as wrappers
to implement time, sleep, and alarm that know about non-integral seconds.

Note: the tests of this module are by definition time sensitive: under
heavy loads the tests may fail.  Reasonable relaxed criteria are being
used for the tests but sometimes you may still see transient failures.
Rerun the tests (make test) a couple of times, preferably with less
load on the testing machine.

Also, older versions of Perl do not support '-nolinenumbers' on the XSUBPP
command, however, 5.004_03 requires it (on my box, anyway) since the #line
generating code in XSUBPP appears to have problems with #ifdef'd .xs code.
If xsubpp complains about usage when you do a make, look at the top of
the Makefile.PL and comment out the "$XSOPT=" line. Or upgrade to a
newer version of Perl.
