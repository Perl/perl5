=head1 NAME

TODO - seeds germane, yet not germinated

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The following functionality will be supported in the next few releases.

=over 4

=item  $Data::Dumper::Expdepth I<or> $I<OBJ>->Expdepth(I<NEWVAL>)

Dump contents explicitly up to a certain depth and then use names for
cross-referencing identical references.  (useful in debugger, in situations
where we don't care so much for cross-references).

=item Make C<Dumpxs()> honor C<$Useqq>

=item Fix formatting when Terse is set and Indent >= 2

=item Output space after '\' (ref constructor) for high enough Indent

=item Implement redesign that allows various backends (Perl, Lisp,
some-binary-data-format, graph-description-languages, etc.)

=item Dump traversal in breadth-first order
