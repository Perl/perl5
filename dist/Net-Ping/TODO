TODO list for Net::Ping (in case anyone is looking for things to do)

- More IPv6 support
Some options like IP_TOS and IP_TTL are not available on IPv6

- POD rewriting
Some things, such as the return from $p->ping(), are cryptic.  The location of the
source is off as well.

- Device
Setting the device uses SO_BINDTODEVICE.  This is Linux-only and should not work anywhere
else.  I think deprecating this is probably the right thing to do.

-TOS
The incoming TOS value can be just about anything from my testing.  This valid values are
supposed to be (in decimal) 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 assuming we aren't talking DS and ECN.
I don't know right now if this is a bug in Socket, Darwin (tesing on Mac OS X currently)
or if that's just the way it is.  Time for some C level testing for this one.
P.S. TOS is IPv4 only.

- Tests
Nicholas Clark converted the tests to Test::More which is a good start.  The tests need some
cleanup and modernizing.  Below is the current test coverage when testing as root.

----------------------------------- ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------
File                                  stmt   bran   cond    sub   time  total
----------------------------------- ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------
blib/lib/Net/Ping.pm                  62.6   42.8   33.0   76.9  100.0   52.6
Total                                 62.6   42.8   33.0   76.9  100.0   52.6
----------------------------------- ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------

This needs to be quite a bit higher all around to make me comfortable with a refactor.
