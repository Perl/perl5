Change log for encoding-warnings

  - Converted Makefile.PL from using Module::Install to ExtUtils::MakeMaker

  - Convert tests from Test.pm to Test::More

0.13 - 2016-06-20

  - Disable module on perl 5.26 and newer. Using it will be a no-op, but will
    issue warnings.
  - Skip tests on EBCDIC systems

0.11 - 2007-06-05

  - This module's effect is now lexical for Perl 5.9.5 and later.
  - "no encoding::warnings" is made more inefficient by doing away
    with an empty encoding handler.
