                                        Time-stamp: "2004-10-06 23:26:53 ADT"

2011-06-12

	* Release 0.36

	Fix broken URLs for RFCs

2004-10-06  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org

	* Release 0.35

	Bugfix version: locale2language_tag now correctly understands
	locale-IDs with at-signs in them, like 'it_IT.utf8@euro' or 
	'it_IT@euro'.  This is now enforced by the new t/20_locales.t

	Thanks to Luca 'loopback' Cavalli for letting me know about these
	new locale-ID name-styles.

	
	* Release 0.34 -- never happened, because of an upload error

	
2004-07-01  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org

	* Release 0.33

	Minor bugfix version:
	The test 80_all_env.t was erroneously failing for people with
	LC_ALL or LC_MESSAGES set.  Fixed.  Thanks to everyone, especially
	Nicholas Clark, who patiently helped out with this.

	
2004-06-20  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org

	* Release 0.32

	Minor bugfix version:
	The test 80_all_env.t was erroneously failing under MSWins that
	had Win32::Locale installed.  A workaround added.
	
	
2004-06-17  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org

	* Release 0.31
	
        Corrected some unevennesses in when/whether the return values from
	I18N::LangTags::Detect's various internal functions would be
	downcased.  Now they're /always/ downcased, and are /always/ fed
	thru alternate_language_tags()!

	Also, spiffed up and generally improved the earlier test
	80_all_env.t, which not even I could make sense of, and I wrote
	the damned thing.  Now it's sane, and checks both scalar and
	list return values.  Thanks to Rafael Garcia-Suarez and the
	various CPAN-Testers for prodding me to fix this.  (Hopefully the
	earlier problems /are/ now fixed!  Otherwise there'll be another
	version of this module out real soon!)

	
2004-03-30  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org

	* Release 0.30

	New in I18N::LangTags : implicate_supers and
	implicate_supers_strictly.

	New module: I18N::LangTags::Detect.

	Some new tests.

	Thanks to Autrijus Tang for catching some errors in my makefile!


	
2003-10-10  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	
	* Release 0.29

	Minor bugfix to I18N::LangTags::List code.  Addition of the
	is_decent function, and the 02decency.t test for it.
	
	Better Makefile.  Thanks to everyone who told me about the
	INSTALLDIRS trick.
	
	
	
2003-07-20  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org

	Deleted rfc3066.txt from dist.
