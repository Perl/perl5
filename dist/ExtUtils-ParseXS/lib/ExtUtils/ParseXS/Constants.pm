=head1 NAME

ExtUtils::ParseXS::Constants - Initialization values for some globals

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ExtUtils::ParseXS::Constants ();

  $PrototypeRegexp = $ExtUtils::ParseXS::Constants::PrototypeRegexp;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Initialization of certain non-subroutine variables in ExtUtils::ParseXS and some of its
supporting packages has been moved into this package so that those values can
be defined exactly once and then re-used in any package.

Nothing is exported.  Use fully qualified variable names.

# and are thus never seen by the parser.
# It also doesn't include non-line-based keywords such as
# IN_OUT, NO_INIT, NO_OUTPUT.
# This list is mainly used by the parser to delineate blocks (such as
# blocks of CODE or lines of INPUT).
