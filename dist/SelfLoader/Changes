1.18    Sat Nov 20 01:30 2010
  - port commit a3a44df66ac2cb0beb603b3dd9697fd81cfcfb30
    from core:
     [perl #72062] Untaint DATA after it's reopened
     DATA handle is untainted on startup, but as we close and reopen it it
     gets the taint flag. It's safe to untaint it though, since we still hold
     the file descriptor open and don't reassign it to another file.
     
     This was probably broken by changeset 29606, (c96b2385 in perl git).
