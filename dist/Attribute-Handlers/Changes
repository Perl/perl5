0.77	Sat Jun  8 22:58:56 CEST 2002

	- Since Attribute::Handlers now is core, I will refer to changes
	with their patch number, please read  Porting/repository.pod from
	your a perl tarball for more information.

	- Brought up to date with perl 5.8RC1 version 
	will be 5.8 if no more changes come in

	- [#13686] This changes the behaviour of lexical attributes.
	Prior to this lexical attributes were done at a compile time, 
	and they would loose their attribute on the next run over them.
	Now perl 5.8 calls the attribute handler runtime whenever it hits my.

	- [#14448] Fixes cases with too high refcounts on lexical attributes

	- [#15945] Do not warn about too late CHECK and INIT block if
	A::H is pulled in using a require.

0.78	Sat Oct  5 07:18:09 CEST 2002
	
	- [#17940] Includes :unique and :shared in the builtin types

	- From perl 5.8 { __CALLER__::foo => __PACKAGE } is missparsed,
	the proper approach is to use  { '__CALLER__::foo' => __PACKAGE }.
	The documentation is updated to reflect this. 
	Reported by Dave Cross

	- From perl change 09330df80caf214f375fcf0c04857347e3b17c69 (Zefram):

          Fix [perl #66970] Incorrect coderef in MODIFY_CODE_ATTRIBUTES

          Attribute handlers being applied to a temporary CV has actually been
          reported as a bug, #66970.  The attached patch fixes the bug, by
          changing the order in which things happen: attributes are now applied
          after the temporary CV has been merged into the existing CV or has
          otherwise been added to the appropriate GV.

          The change breaks part of Attribute::Handlers.  Part of A:H searches the
          package to find the name of the sub to which a :ATTR attribute is being
          applied, and the correct time at which to launch that search depends
          crucially on the order in which the CV construction events occur. So
          this patch also includes a change to A:H, to make it detect which way
          things happen.  The resulting A:H works either way, which is essential
          for its dual-life nature.
