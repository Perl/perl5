5.66 Wed Dec 23 2011 Todd Rinaldo
    - No changes. Production release after CPAN testers cleared.

5.65_01 Wed Dec 14 2011 Todd Rinaldo
    - Updaate Exporter from blead. Bump to dev version for release testing.
    - Remove local $_ from Exporter - The changes in that commit did
      not necessitate the addition of
      local  $_.  So the localisation is wasting CPU cycles.  Worse, it
      causes  bugs in 5.12 and earlier.  (local $_ is always wrong if you
      don’t control what is in $_ already, because it could be a read-only
      tied variable.)  Actually, it causes bugs in 5.14-15 still, because
      it seems that the changes to ‘local $_’ still weren’t sufficient (it
      still calls FETCH, but not STORE).  That itself needs fixing, but that
      should not obviate the need for this change, as Exporter has been liv-
      ing a double life.
