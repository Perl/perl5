0.87    Fri May 20 20:00:00 CET 2011

    - Port changes from core: Whitespace fix that is significant for

0.88    Mon Dec 19 18:26:00 CET 2011

    - [perl #92436] Make Filter::Simple match variables better
      (Father Chrysostomos)

    - [perl #92436] Filter::Simple can’t find end of POD
      (Father Chrysostomos)

0.91    Fri Mar  7 08:30:00 CET 2014

    - Various small documentation fixes.

    - Swap out base.pm use for parent.pm.

0.94    Thu Aug  3 18:00:00 CET 2017

    - Remove use of deprecated \C regex feature.

    - Filter::Simple was erroneously signalling eof if it encountered a
      ‘no MyFilter’ right after ‘use’:
        use MyFilter;
        no MyFilter;
      In this case it should simply not filter anything.
