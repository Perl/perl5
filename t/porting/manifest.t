# * What does this test? *
#
# This tests the well-formed-ness of the MANIFEST file
# and of the Porting/MANIFEST.dev file, and if git is present
# it will confirm that every file known to git ls-files is
# listed in one of the two MANIFEST files.
#
# * Why do we test this? *
#
# We want to keep the files sorted according to our preferred
# sort order. See t/manifest_lib.pm for details. We also want
# to ensure that the file doesn't have any issues that would
# break any parsers that process it.
#
# * It's broken - how do I fix it? *
#
# If MANIFEST or Porting/MANIFEST.dev are not sorted properly,
# you will get this error output something like this:
#
#      got ''MANIFEST' is NOT sorted properly'
#      # expected /(?^:is sorted properly)/
#
# To correct this, run this:
#
#   make manisort
#
# which will output something like "WARNING: re-sorting MANIFEST" but which
# will also correct the problem. This will sort BOTH files with one simple
# command so it is the preferred option.
#
# Alternatively you can manually run what it does under the hood:
#
#   ./perl -Ilib Porting/manisort -o MANIFEST MANIFEST
#   ./perl -Ilib Porting/manisort -o Porting/MANIFEST.dev Porting/MANIFEST.dev
#
# which will output something like "'MANIFEST' is NOT sorted properly" but
# which will also correct the problem.
#
# For other errors you may need to hand edit the file, for instance if a file
# is listed in both MANIFEST or Porting/MANIFEST.dev then you will need to
# decide which file should keep the listing. The rule of thumb is whether
# the file is used only for development purposes when there is a git repo
# available, in which case it should go in Porting/MANIFEST.dev, or if the
# file is required to build perl, in which case it should go in MANIFEST.
# If the file is missing outright you will need to add the file to one of the
# manifests, etc.
#
# Note the file format for MANIFEST files uses *tabs* as a separator, NOT
# spaces, and mixed tabs and spaces as a separator will trigger a test
# failure. Make sure the separator does not contain spaces. You may add a
# description for each file after the tabs, but it is not required. If you
# omit the description then you should trim trailing spaces from the line.
# The description itself may contain spaces however.
