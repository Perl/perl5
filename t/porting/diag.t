# The first set are entries whose text we think is fully explanatory and don't
# need further elaboration in perldiag.  This set should consist of very few
# entries.
#
# The second set, after the blank line, consists of TODO entries.  (There are
# actually two subsets described below.)  This list should basically be just
# those entries that otherwise would have generated an error upon inauguration
# of this program, so we didn't have to go from "meh" to perfect all at once.
# The only valid reason we can think of to add to the list is for cases where
# this program is not smart enough to recognize the message is something that
# actually is in perldiag.  Otherwise, DO NOT ADD TO THIS LIST.  Instead,
# write an entry in pod/perldiag.pod for your new (warning|error).
#
# This second set has a subcategory, after the line marked __CATEGORIES__ .
# These are entries that are in perldiag but fail the severity/category test.
