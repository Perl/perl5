# This file is the data file for porting/podcheck.t.
# There are three types of lines.
# Comment lines are white-space only or begin with a '#', like this one.  Any
#   changes you make to the comment lines will be lost when the file is
#   regen'd.
# Lines without tab characters are simply NAMES of pods that the program knows
#   will have links to them and the program does not check if those links are
#   valid.
# All other lines should have three fields, each separated by a tab.  The
#   first field is the name of a pod; the second field is an error message
#   generated by this program; and the third field is a count of how many
#   known instances of that message there are in the pod.  -1 means that the
#   program can expect any number of this type of message.
