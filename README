--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perl is a language that combines some of the features of C, sed, awk and shell.
See the manual page for more hype.

Perl will probably not run on machines with a small address space.

Please read all the directions below before you proceed any further, and
then follow them carefully.

After you have unpacked your kit, you should have all the files listed
in MANIFEST.

Installation

1)  Run Configure.  This will figure out various things about your system.
    Some things Configure will figure out for itself, other things it will
    ask you about.  It will then proceed to make config.h, config.sh, and
    Makefile.

    You might possibly have to trim # comments from the front of Configure
    if your sh doesn't handle them, but all other # comments will be taken
    care of.

    (If you don't have sh, you'll have to copy the sample file config.H to
    config.h and edit the config.h to reflect your system's peculiarities.)

2)  Glance through config.h to make sure system dependencies are correct.
    Most of them should have been taken care of by running the Configure script.

    If you have any additional changes to make to the C definitions, they
    can be done in the Makefile, or in config.h.  Bear in mind that they will
    get undone next time you run Configure.

3)  make depend

    This will look for all the includes and modify Makefile accordingly.
    Configure will offer to do this for you.

4)  make

    This will attempt to make perl in the current directory.

5)  make test

    This will run the regression tests on the perl you just made.
    If it doesn't say "All tests successful" then something went wrong.
    See the README in the t subdirectory.  Note that you can't run it
    in background if this disables opening of /dev/tty.  If "make test"
    bombs out, just cd to the t directory and run TEST by hand to see if
    it makes any difference.

6)  make install

    This will put perl into a public directory (such as /usr/local/bin).
    It will also try to put the man pages in a reasonable place.  It will not
    nroff the man page, however.  You may need to be root to do this.  If
    you are not root, you must own the directories in question and you should
    ignore any messages about chown not working.

7)  Read the manual entry before running perl.

8)  IMPORTANT!  Help save the world!  Communicate any problems and suggested
    patches to me, lwall@jpl-devvax.jpl.nasa.gov (Larry Wall), so we can
    keep the world in sync.  If you have a problem, there's someone else
    out there who either has had or will have the same problem.

    If possible, send in patches such that the patch program will apply them.
    Context diffs are the best, then normal diffs.  Don't send ed scripts--
    I've probably changed my copy since the version you have.

    Watch for perl patches in comp.sources.bugs.  Patches will generally be
    in a form usable by the patch program.  If you are just now bringing up
    perl and aren't sure how many patches there are, write to me and I'll
    send any you don't have.  Your current patch level is shown in patchlevel.h.


Just a personal note:  I want you to know that I create nice things like this
because it pleases the Author of my story.  If this bothers you, then your
notion of Authorship needs some revision.  But you can use perl anyway. :-)
