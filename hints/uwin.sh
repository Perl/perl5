# __UWIN__ added so it could be used in ext/POSIX/POSIX.xs
# to protect against either tzname definition.  According to Dave Korn

#dgk gcc on uwin also predefined _UWIN as does the digital mars compiler.
#dgk
#dgk Only ncc does not define _UWIN and this is intentional.  ncc is used
#dgk to build binaries that do not require the uwin runtime.
#dgk This could be used for building a native win32 perl using unix
#dgk makefiles.  However, in this case you don't wan't _UWIN defined.
#dgk
#dgk I have used _UWIN everywhere else in any uwin specific changes.
#dgk and _WIN32 on windows specific changes, and _MSVC on any compiler
#dgk Visual C specific changes.  We also define _WINIX for any unix
#dgk on windows implementation so that _UWIN or __cygwin__ imply _WINIX.

# I left __UWIN__ as is, since I had already filed a patch,
# and it might be useful to distinguish perl-specific tweaks
# from generic uwin ones.

# This from Dave Korn
#dgk Windows splits shared libraries into two parts; the part used
#dgk for linking and the part that is used for running.
#dgk Given a library foo, then the part you link with is named
#dgk	foo.lib
#dgk and is in the lib directory.  The part that you run with
#dgk is named
#dgk	foo.dll or foo#.dll
#dgk and is in the bin directory.  This way when you set you PATH
#dgk variable, it automatically does the library search.
#dgk
#dgk Static libraries use libfoo.a.
#dgk By the way if you specify -lfoo, then it will first look for foo.lib
#dgk and then libfoo.a.  If you specify +lfoo, it will only look for
#dgk static versions of the library.

# So we use .lib as the extension, and put -lm in, because it is a .a
# This probably accounts for the comment about dynamic libraries
# needing work, and indeed, the build failed if I didn't undef it.

# lest it default to .exe, and then there's no perl in the test directory,

# by Configure (on 5/23/2003) if exe_ext is merely null, so clean it out, too.

# Some other comments:
# If you see something like

#          got: '/E/users/jpl/src/cmd/perl/t'
#     expected: '/e/users/jpl/src/cmd/perl/t'
#     Failed test (../dist/Cwd/t/cwd.t at line 88)

# when running tests under harness, try the simple expedient of
# changing to directory
#     /E/users/jpl/src/cmd/perl/t   # note the leading capital /E
# before running the tests.  UWIN is a bit schizophrenic about case.
# It likes to return an uppercase "disk" letter for the leading directory,
# but your home directory may well have that in lower case.
# In most cases, they are entirely interchangeable, but the perl tests
# don't ignore case.  If they fail, change to the directory they expect.
