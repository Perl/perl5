# hints/dec_osf.sh

#	* If you want to debug perl or want to send a
#	stack trace for inclusion into an bug report, call
#	Configure with the additional argument  -Doptimize=-g2
#	or uncomment this assignment to "optimize":
#
#optimize=-g2
#
#	If you want both to optimise and debug with the DEC cc
#	you must have -g3, e.g. "-O4 -g3", and (re)run Configure.
#
#	* gcc can always have both -g and optimisation on.
#
#	* debugging optimised code, no matter what compiler
#	one is using, can be surprising and confusing because of
#	the optimisation tricks like code motion, code removal,
#	loop unrolling, and inlining. The source code and the
#	executable code simply do not agree any more while in
#	mid-execution, the optimiser only cares about the results.
#
#	* Configure will automatically add the often quoted
#	-DDEBUGGING for you if the -g is specified.
#
#	* There is even more optimisation available in the new
#	(GEM) DEC cc: -O5 and -fast. "man cc" will tell more about them.
#	The jury is still out whether either or neither help for Perl
#	and how much. Based on very quick testing, -fast boosts
#	raw data copy by about 5-15% (-fast brings in, among other
#	things, inlined, ahem, fast memcpy()), while on the other
#	hand searching things (index, m//, s///), seems to get slower.
#	Your mileage will vary.
#
#	* The -std is needed because the following compiled
#	without the -std and linked with -lm
#
#	#include <math.h>
#	#include <stdio.h>
#	int main(){short x=10,y=sqrt(x);printf("%d\n",y);}
#
#	will in Digital UNIX 3.* and 4.0b print 0 -- and in Digital
#	UNIX 4.0{,a} dump core: Floating point exception in the printf(),
#	the y has become a signaling NaN.
#
#	* Compilation warnings like:
#
#	"Undefined the ANSI standard macro ..."
#
#	can be ignored, at least while compiling the POSIX extension
#	and especially if using the sfio (the latter is not a standard
#	part of Perl, never mind if it says little to you).
#

# If using the DEC compiler we must find out the DEC compiler style:
# the style changed between Digital UNIX (aka DEC OSF/1) 3 and
# Digital UNIX 4. The old compiler was originally from Ultrix and
# the MIPS company, the new compiler is originally from the VAX world
# and it is called GEM. Many of the options we are going to use depend
# on the compiler style.

Your process datasize is limited to $maxdsiz MB, which is (sadly) not
always enough to fully optimize some source code files of Perl,
at least 256 MB seems to be necessary as of Perl 5.8.0.  I'll try to
use a lower optimization level for those parts.  You could either try
using your shell's ulimit/limit/limits command to raise your datasize
(assuming the system-wide hard resource limits allow you to go higher),
or if you can't go higher and if you are a sysadmin, and you *do* want
the full optimization, you can tune the 'max_per_proc_data_size'
kernel parameter: see man sysconfigtab, and man sys_attrs_proc.

#
#
# perl5.003_28:

#	* Restructuring Spider's suggestions.
#
#	* Older Digital UNIXes cannot handle -Olimit ... for $lddlflags.
#
#	* ld -s cannot be used in older Digital UNIXes when doing shared.
#
#
#       21-Feb-1997 Spider Boardman <spider@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>
#
#	* -hidden removed.
#
#	* -DSTANDARD_C removed.
#
#	* -D_INTRINSICS added. (that -fast does not seem to buy much confirmed)
#
#	* odbm not in libc, only ndbm. Therefore dbm back to $libswanted.
#
#	* -msym for the newer runtime loaders.

#
#
# perl5.003_27:

#

#	  optimize is an empty string.
#
#
#	17-Jan-1997 Achim Bohnet <ach@rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de>
#
#	* Removed 'dl' from libswanted: When the FreePort binary

#	  that it should use libdl.x.yz.fpx.so :-(
#	  Because the dlopen, dlclose,... calls are in the

#
#
#	1-Jan-1997 Achim Bohnet <ach@rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de>
#
#	* Set -Olimit to 3200 because perl_yylex.c got too big
#	  for the optimizer.
