#
# For consistency with gcc, we do not adopt Sun Marketing's
# removal of the '2.' prefix from the Solaris version number.
# (Configure tries to detect an old fixincludes and needs
# this information.)

# If perl fails tests that involve dynamic loading of extensions, and
# you are using gcc, be sure that you are NOT using GNU as and ld.  One
# way to do that is to invoke Configure with
#
#     sh Configure -Dcc='gcc -B/usr/ccs/bin/'
#
#  (Note that the trailing slash is *required*.)
#  gcc will occasionally emit warnings about "unused prefix", but
#  these ought to be harmless.  See below for more details.

I'm therefore disabling the use of long doubles.
