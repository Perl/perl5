# unistd.h contains incorrect prototypes for some functions in the usual
# BSD-ish environment.  In particular, it has
# extern int	getgroups(/* int gidsetsize, gid_t grouplist[] */);
# but groupslist[] ought to be of type int, not gid_t.
# This is only really a problem for perl if the
# user is using gcc, and not running in the SysV environment.
# The gcc fix-includes script exposes those incorrect prototypes.
# There may be other examples as well.  Volunteers are welcome to
# track them all down :-).  In the meantime, we'll just skip unistd.h
# for SunOS in most of the code.   
# However, see ext/POSIX/hints/sunos_4.pl for one exception.

# fflush(NULL) will core dump on SunOS 4.1.3.  In util.c we'll
# try explicitly fflushing all open files.  Unfortunately,
# on my SunOS 4.1.3 system, sysconf(_SC_OPEN_MAX) returns
# 64, but only 32 of those file pointers can be accessed 
# directly by _iob[i].  The remainder are off in dynamically
# allocated memory somewhere and I don't know to automatically
# fflush() them.  -- Andy Dougherty  Wed May 26 15:25:22 EDT 1999

# The correct setting of groupstype depends on which version of the C
# library is used.  If you are in the 'System V environment'
# (i.e. you have /usr/5bin ahead of /usr/bin in your PATH), and
# you use Sun's cc compiler, then you'll pick up /usr/5bin/cc, which
# links against the C library in /usr/5lib.  This library has
# groupstype='gid_t'.
# If you are in the normal BSDish environment, then you'll pick up
# /usr/ucb/cc, which links against the C library in /usr/lib.  That
# library has groupstype='int'.
#
# If you are using gcc, it links against the C library in /usr/lib
# independent of whether or not you are in the 'System V environment'.
# If you want to use the System V libraries, then you need to 
# manually set groupstype='gid_t' and add explicit references to 
# /usr/5lib when Configure prompts you for where to look for libraries.

# If you get the message "unresolved symbol '__lib_version' " while
# linking, your system probably has the optional 'acc' compiler (and
# libraries) installed, but you are using the bundled 'cc' compiler with
# the unbundled libraries.  The solution is either to use 'acc' and the
# unbundled libraries (specifically /lib/libm.a), or 'cc' and the bundled
# library.
