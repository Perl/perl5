=head1 NAME

perllinux - Perl version 5 on Linux systems

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes various features of Linux that will affect how Perl
version 5 (hereafter just Perl) is compiled and/or runs.

=head2 Experimental Support for Sun Studio Compilers for Linux OS

Sun Microsystems has released a port of their Sun Studio compilers for
Linux.  As of November 2005, only an alpha version has been released.  
Until a release of these compilers is made, support for compiling Perl with
these compiler experimental.

Also, some special instructions for building Perl with Sun Studio on Linux.
Following the normal C<Configure>, you have to run make as follows:

    LDLOADLIBS=-lc make

C<LDLOADLIBS> is an environment variable used by the linker to link modules
C</ext> modules to glibc.  Currently, that environment variable is not getting
populated by a combination of C<Config> entries and C<ExtUtil::MakeMaker>.
While there may be a bug somewhere in Perl's configuration or
C<ExtUtil::MakeMaker> causing the problem, the most likely cause is an
incomplete understanding of Sun Studio by this author.  Further investigation
is needed to get this working better.
