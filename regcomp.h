 * Structure for regexp "program".  This is essentially a linear encoding

 * plus a "next" pointer, possibly plus an operand.  "Next" pointers of
 * all nodes except BRANCH implement concatenation; a "next" pointer with
 * a BRANCH on both ends of it is connecting two alternatives.  (Here we
 * have one of the subtle syntax dependencies:  an individual BRANCH (as
 * opposed to a collection of them) is never concatenated with anything
 * because of operator precedence.)  The operand of some types of node is
 * a literal string; for others, it is a node leading into a sub-FSM.  In
 * particular, the operand of a BRANCH node is the first node of the branch.
 * (NB this is *not* a tree structure:  the tail of the branch connects
 * to the thing following the set of BRANCHes.)  The opcodes are defined
 * in regnodes.h which is generated from regcomp.sym by regcomp.pl.

 * A node is one char of opcode followed by two chars of "next" pointer.

 * value is a positive offset from the opcode of the node containing it.
 * An operand, if any, simply follows the node.  (Note that much of the
 * code generation knows about this implicit relationship.)
 *
 * Using two bytes for the "next" pointer is vast overkill for most things,
 * but allows patterns to get big without disasters.
 *
 * [The "next" pointer is always aligned on an even
 * boundary, and reads the offset directly as a short.]

/* Define the various regnode structures. These all should be a multiple
 * of 32 bits large, and they should by and large correspond with each other
 * in terms of naming, etc. Things can and will break in subtle ways if you
 * change things without care. If you look at regexp.h you will see it
 * contains this:
 *
 * union regnode_head {
 *   struct {
 *     union {
 *       U8 flags;
 *       U8 str_len_u8;
 *       U8 first_byte;
 *     } u_8;
 *     U8  type;
 *     U16 next_off;
 *   } data;
 *   U32 data_u32;
 * };
 *
 * struct regnode {
 *   union regnode_head head;
 * };
 *
 * Which really is a complicated and alignment friendly version of
 *
 *  struct {
 *    U8  flags;
 *    U8  type;
 *    U16 next_off;
 *  };
 *
 * This structure is the base unit of elements in the regexp program.
 * When we increment our way through the program we increment by the
 * size of this structure (32 bits), and in all cases where regnode
 * sizing is considered it is in units of this structure. All regnodes
 * have a union regnode_head as their first parameter.
 *
 * This implies that no regnode style structure should contain 64 bit
 * aligned members. Since the base regnode is 32 bits any member might
 * not be 64 bit aligned no matter how you might try to pad out the
 * struct itself (the regnode_ssc is special in this regard as it is
 * never used in a program directly). If you want to store 64 bit
 * members you need to store them specially. The struct regnode_p and the
 * ARGp() and ARGp_SET() macros and related inline functions provide an example
 * solution. Note they deal with a slightly more complicated problem than simple
 * alignment, as pointers may be 32 bits or 64 bits depending on platform,
 * but they illustrate the pattern to follow if you want to put a 64 bit value
 * into a regnode.

 * NOTE: Ideally we do not put pointers into the regnodes in a program. Instead
 * we put them in the "data" part of the regexp structure and store the index into
 * the data in the pointers in the regnode. This allows the pointer to be handled
 * properly during clone/free operations (eg refcount bookkeeping). See S_add_data(),
 * Perl_regdupe_internal(), Perl_regfree_internal() in regcomp.c for how the data
 * array can be used, the letters 'arsSu' all refer to different types of SV that
 * we already have support for in the data array.

/* Core macros for computing "the regnode after this one". See also
 * Perl_regnode_after() in reginline.h
 *
 * At the struct level regnodes are a linked list, with each node pointing
 * at the next (via offsets), usually via the C<next_off> field in the
 * structure. Where there is a need for a node to have two children the
 * immediate physical successor of the node in the compiled program is used
 * to represent one of them. A good example is the BRANCH construct,
 * consider the pattern C</head(?:[ab]foo|[cd]bar)tail/>
 *
 *      1: EXACT <head> (3)
 *      3: BRANCH (8)
 *      4:   ANYOFR[ab] (6)
 *      6:   EXACT <foo> (14)
 *      8: BRANCH (FAIL)
 *      9:   ANYOFR[cd] (11)
 *     11:   EXACT <bar> (14)
 *     13: TAIL (14)
 *     14: EXACT <tail> (16)
 *     16: END (0)
 *
 * The numbers in parens at the end of each line show the "next_off" value
 * for that regnode in the program. We can see that the C<next_off> of
 * the first BRANCH node (#3) is the second BRANCH node (#8), and indicates
 * where execution should go if the regnodes *following* the BRANCH node fail
 * to accept the input string. Thus to find the "next BRANCH" we would do
 * C<Perl_regnext()> and follow the C<next_off> pointer, and to find
 * the "BRANCHes contents" we would use C<REGNODE_AFTER()>.
 *
 * Be aware that C<REGNODE_AFTER()> is not guaranteed to give a *useful*
 * result once the regex peephole optimizer has run (it will be correct
 * however!). By the time code in regexec.c executes various regnodes
 * may have been optimized out of the C<next_off> chain. An example
 * can be seen above, node 13 will never be reached during execution
 * flow as it has been stitched out of the C<next_off> chain. Both 6 and
 * 11 would have pointed at it during compilation, but it exists only to
 * facilitate the construction of the BRANCH structure and is effectively
 * a NOOP, and thus the optimizer adjusts the links so it is skipped
 * from execution time flow. In regexec.c it is only safe to use
 * REGNODE_AFTER() on specific node types.
 *
 * Conversely during compilation C<Perl_regnext()> may not work properly
 * as the C<next_off> may not be known until "later", (such as in the
 * case of BRANCH nodes) and thus in regcomp.c the REGNODE_AFTER() macro
 * is used very heavily instead.
 *
 * There are several variants of the REGNODE_AFTER_xxx() macros which
 * are intended for use in different situations depending on how
 * confident the code is about what type of node it is trying to find a
 * successor for.
 *
 * So for instance if you know you are dealing with a known node type of
 * constant size then you should use REGNODE_AFTER_type(n,TYPE).
 *
 * If you have a regnode pointer and you know you are dealing with a
 * regnode type of constant size and you have already extracted its
 * opcode use: REGNODE_AFTER_opcode(n,OPCODE).
 *
 * If you have a regnode and you know it is variable size then you
 * you can produce optimized code by using REGNODE_AFTER_varies(n).
 *
 * If you have a regnode pointer and nothing else use: REGNODE_AFTER(n)
 * This is the safest option and wraps C<Perl_regnode_after()>. It
 * should produce the correct result regardless of its argument. The
 * other options only produce correct results under specific
 * constraints.

/* There are also ANYOFM nodes, used when the bit patterns representing the
 * matched code points happen to be such that they can be checked by ANDing
 * with a mask.  The regex compiler looks for and silently optimizes to using
 * this node type in the few cases where it works out.  The eight octal digits
 * form such a group.  These nodes are simple and fast and no further
 * discussion is needed here.
 *
 * And, there are ANYOFH-ish nodes which match only code points that aren't in
 * the bitmap  (the H stands for High).  These are common for expressing
 * Unicode properties concerning non-Latin scripts.  They dispense with the
 * bitmap altogether and don't need any of the flags discussed below.
 *
 * And, there are ANYOFR-ish nodes which match within a single range.
 *
 * When there is a need to specify what matches outside the bitmap, it is done
 * by allocating an AV as part of the pattern's compiled form, and the argument
 * to the node instead of being ANYOF_ONLY_HAS_BITMAP, points to that AV.
 *
 * (Actually, that is an oversimplification.  The AV is placed into the
 * pattern's struct reg_data, and what is stored in the node's argument field
 * is its index into that struct.  And the inversion list is just one element,
 * the zeroth, of the AV.)
 *
 * There are certain situations where a single inversion list can't handle all
 * the complexity.  These are dealt with by having extra elements in the AV, by
 * specifying flag bits in the ANYOF node, and/or special code.  As an example,
 * there are instances where what the ANYOF node matches is not completely
 * known until runtime.  In these cases, a flag is set, and the bitmap has a 1
 * for the code points which are known at compile time to be 1, and a 0 for the
 * ones that are known to be 0, or require runtime resolution.  Some missing
 * information can be found by merely seeing if the pattern is UTF-8 or not;
 * other cases require looking at the extra elements in the AV.
 *
 * There are 5 cases where the bitmap is insufficient.  These are specified by
 * flags in the node's flags field.  We could use five bits to represent the 5
 * cases, but to save flags bits (which are perennially in short supply), we
 * play some games.  The cases are:
 *
 *  1)  As already mentioned, if some code points outside the bitmap match, and
 *      some do not, an inversion list is specified to indicate which ones.
 *
 *  2)  Under /d rules, it can happen that code points that are in the upper
 *      latin1 range (\x80-\xFF or their equivalents on EBCDIC platforms) match
 *      only if the runtime target string being matched against is UTF-8.  For
 *      example /[\w[:punct:]]/d.  This happens only for certain posix classes,
 *      and all such ones also have above-bitmap matches.
 *
 *      Note that /d rules are no longer encouraged; 'use 5.14' or higher
 *      deselects them.  But they are still supported, and a flag is required
 *      so that they can be properly handled.  But it can be a shared flag: see
 *      4) below.
 *
 *  3)  Also under /d rules, something like /[\Wfoo]/ will match everything in
 *      the \x80-\xFF range, unless the string being matched against is UTF-8.
 *      An inversion list could be created for this case, but this is
 *      relatively common, and it turns out that it's all or nothing:  if any
 *      one of these code points matches, they all do.  Hence a single bit
 *      suffices.  We use a shared flag that doesn't take up space by itself:
 *      ANYOFD_NON_UTF8_MATCHES_ALL_NON_ASCII__shared.  This also means there
 *      is an inversion list for the things that don't fit into the bitmap.
 *
 *  4)  A user-defined \p{} property may not have been defined by the time the
 *      regex is compiled.  In this case, we don't know until runtime what it
 *      will match, so we have to assume it could match anything, including
 *      code points that ordinarily would be in the bitmap.  A flag bit is
 *      necessary to indicate this, though we can use the
 *      ANYOF_HAS_EXTRA_RUNTIME_MATCHES flag, along with the node not being
 *      ANYOFD.  The information required to construct the property is stored
 *      in the AV pointed to by the node's argument.  This case is quite
 *      uncommon in the field, and the /(?[...])/ construct is a better way to
 *      accomplish what this feature does.
 *
 *  5)  /[foo]/il may have folds that are only valid if the runtime locale is a
 *      UTF-8 one.  The ANYOF_HAS_EXTRA_RUNTIME_MATCHES flag can also be used
 *      for these.  The list is stored in a different element of the AV, so its
 *      existence differentiates this case from that of 4), along with the node
 *      being ANYOFL, with the ANYOFL_FOLD flag being set.  There are a few
 *      additional folds valid only if the UTF-8 locale is a Turkic one which
 *      is tested for explicitly.
 *
 * Note that the user-defined property flag and the /il flag can affect whether
 * an ASCII character matches in the bitmap or not.
 *
 * And this still isn't the end of the story.  In some cases, warnings are
 * supposed to be raised when matching certain categories of code points in the
 * target string.  Flags are set to indicate this.  This adds up to a bunch of
 * flags required, and we only have 8 available.  That is why we share some.
 * At the moment, there are two spare flag bits, but this could be increased by
 * various tricks:
 *
 * ANYOF_MATCHES_POSIXL is redundant with the node type ANYOFPOSIXL.  That flag
 * could be removed, but at the expense of having to write extra code, which
 * would take up space, and writing this turns out to be not hard, but not
 * trivial.
 *
 * If this is done, an extension would be to make all ANYOFL nodes contain the
 * extra 32 bits that ANYOFPOSIXL ones do, doubling each instance's size.  The
 * posix flags only occupy 30 bits, so the ANYOFL_FOLD  and
 * ANYOFL_UTF8_LOCALE_REQD bits could be moved to that extra space, but it
 * would also mean extra instructions, as there are currently places in the
 * code that assume those two bits are zero.
 *
 * Some flags are not used in synthetic start class (SSC) nodes, so could be
 * shared should new flags be needed for SSCs, like SSC_MATCHES_EMPTY_STRING
 * now. */
