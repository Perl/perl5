		ChangeLog for Locale-Codes Distribution

2.00  2002-02-17 neilb

	* Created Locale::Script which provides an interface to the
	  ISO codes for identification of scripts (writing scripts,
	  rather than perl style scripts). The codes are defined
	  by ISO 15924, which is currently in final draft.
	  Thanks to Jarkko for pointing out this new standard.
	  All three code sets are supported, and a test-suite added.

	* Added support for country name variants to Locale::Country,
	  so that
		country2code('USA')
		country2code('United States')
		country2code('United States of America')
	  will all return 'us'.
	  This had been in the LIMITATIONS section since the first version.
	  Patch from TJ Mather <tjmather@tjmather.com> with additional
	  variants from me. Added test-cases for these.

	* Added VERSION to Locale::Constants. Thanks to Jarkko for
	  pointing that it was missing.

	* Should really have bumped major version with previous release,
	  since there was a change to the API.

1.06  2001-03-04 neilb

	Added Locale::Constants, which defines three symbols
	for identifying which codeset is being used:

		LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2
		LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_3
		LOCALE_CODE_NUMERIC

	Updated Locale::Country to support all three code sets
	defined by ISO 3166. This was requested by Keith Wall.
	I haven't added multiple codeset support to the other
	modules yet - I'll wait until someone asks for them.

1.05  Feb 2001

	Added Locale::Currency, contribution from Michael Hennecke.
	Added testsuite for it (t/currency.t) and added testcases
	to t/all.t for the all_* functions.

1.04  Dec 2000

	Fixed very minor typos from 1.03!

1.03  Dec 2000

	Updated Locale::Country:
		- fixed spelling of a few countries
		- added link to a relevant page from CIA world factbook

	Updated Locale::Language:
		- fixed typo in the documentation (ISO 939 should be 639)

1.02  May 2000

	Updated Locale::Country and Locale::Language to reflect changes
	in the relevant ISO standards. These mainly reflect languages
	which are new to the relevant standard, and changes in the
	spelling of some country names.

	Added official URLs for the standards to the SEE ALSO sections
	of the doc for each module.

	Thanks to Jarkko Hietaniemi for pointing me at the pages
	with latest versions of ISO 3166 and 639.

1.00  March 1998

	Added Locale::Country::_alias_code() so that 'uk' can be added
	as the code for "United Kingdom", if you want it.
	This was prompted by Ed Jordan <ed@chronos.net>

	Added a new testsuite for handling this case, and extended the
	existing test-suite to include testing of the case where
	'uk' hasn't been defined as a valid code.

0.003 May 1997

	First public release to CPAN
