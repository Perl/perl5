There used to be a directory called lib/unicode but everything that
used to be here is now in the lib/unicore directory.

The renaming was done to avoid naming conflicts with the Perl core
Unicode files and modules in the Unicode:: space in case-ignoring
filesystems.  The lib/Unicode directory now contains various
Unicode-related modules.
