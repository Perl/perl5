2003-02-05  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* lib/CPAN.pm (savehist, CPAN::shell): new config variables
	histfile and histsize control saving and retrieving of history.

	* Explain the status of CPAN.pm vs. CPANPLUS.pm in the POD

	* Documentation: mention FTP_PASSIVE; courtesy Peter Valdemar
	Mørch

2002-11-22  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* correct all split commands to use a regex instead of a string.
	Thanks to Rafael Garcia-Suarez for detecting the abuse.

2002-11-17  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* BUNDLE/Test/{Builder,More}.pm: Strip POD from the two bundled
	modules.

2002-11-15  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Makefile.PL: Switch to CPAN::MakeMaker for this one experimental
	release. The implications of CPAN::MakeMaker are yet to be
	evaluated. Here I use the "True Bundle" feature to add Test::More
	and Test::Builder and remove the dependency on them.

2002-11-12  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* lib/CPAN/FirstTime.pm (read_mirrored_by): Bill Pollock made me
	aware about simple mistakes that can be avoided in the URL
	selection dialogue (entering URL strings instead of numbers,
	entering leading or trailing whitespace). With a few simple tweaks
	these should be avoided in the future.

2002-10-20  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* lib/CPAN.pm: the last few patches also fixed accidentally some
	"redefined" warnings during "reload cpan".

2002-09-30  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Roland Bauer sent me a patch that carefully appended a trailing
	newline to a couple of "mywarn" messages that came without it.
	
	* CPAN::FirstTime::display_some: Change the displayed dialogue to
	make clear that SPACE ENTER is the trick to page through results.
	Correct some indenting and trailing whitespace. Remove some unused
	variables.

	* print_ornamented: Newline fix for various Windows systems by
	Roland Bauer

2002-09-03  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* CPAN::FirstTime::init: Catch non-absolute path in cpan_home.

2002-08-30  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* New version of the cpan script by brian d foy.

2002-07-28  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Releasing as 1.62.

	* cpan: beefed-up cpan script courtesy brian d foy.

	* Makefile.PL: deactivate PREREQ_PM for File::Spec in case we are
	running under 5.6.0, otherwise 5.6.0's CPAN.pm would download
	5.8.0 just for File::Spec.

2002-05-07  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Releasing as 1.61.

	* The default WAIT server has got a new domain name:
	ls6-www.informatik.uni-dortmund.de

	* Protecting against not existing $META->{is_tested} element.

2002-04-21  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Repackaging, no changes in the code. The reason is that
	search.cpan.org could not grok the format of my ChangeLog file
	which mixed POD and non-POD. Now ChangeLog is POD-free and old
	Changes are in Changes.old. Going to package as 1.60b.

2002-04-19  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Change the quoting in system command for Windows systems. Thanks
	to Alessandro Forghieri <alf at orion dot it> for the report.

	* merge with bleadperl 

2001-06-16  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Typo Frontent->Frontend in three places. Thanks to Rich Williams
	for spotting.

2001-05-28  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* manpage_headline: fixed the NAME parsing regular expression to
	ignore headlines that just start with NAME. Thanks to Jost Krieger
	for spotting.

2001-05-22  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* CPAN::Bundle::look: disable the look command on bundles. Till
	now it meant to recursively look into all members. This could be
	time-consuming and even hard to interrupt. As I know nothing else
	one could expect from look(Bundle), I decided to disable it
	completely.

2001-04-xx  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Do not remember exact date: Applied a patch by Gisle Aas to
	replace MD5 by Digest::MD5.

2001-02-09  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Releasing as 1.59_54.

	* CPAN::Tarzip::TIEHANDLE: Applied a patch by Robin Barker
	<rmb1@cise.npl.co.uk> about a wrong error message ("Could pipe"
	instead of "Could not pipe")

2001-02-06  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* CPAN::Index::rd_modpacks: Add a stalenes warning if the index
	file is older than 30 days. Thanks to "tanbin"
	<tiger40490@yahoo.com> for the report.

	* To improve the protection against stale mirrors, add a global
	for $CPAN::Index::DATE_OF_02 to keep track of the currently used
	index. This is also stored in the cache. It will be printed as a
	reminder whenever a fetch fails and whenever the metadata are
	retrieved from the index file or via Storable.

2001-01-02  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* CPAN::Author::as_glimpse): added email address

	* CPAN::Shell::a: uppercasing any argument broke experimental
	advanced query. Made conditional on the existence of an equal sign
	now.

2000-12-31  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* POD: add a description of the ls command.

	* Improve documentation of support for authenticated proxies.

	* CPAN::Bundle::contains: Bail out if there is no inst_file and
	cpan_file eq "N/A". Old code would have tried to download N/A.

2000-12-27  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* normalize: Fix bug with "Strange distribution name" if it is
	"Contact Author..."

2000-12-26  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* CPAN::LWP::UserAgent: new class to customize proxy
	authentication. Thanks to David C Worenklein for a working
	implementation that I could use as a basis.

2000-12-19  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* manpage: Added a pointer to the Japanese translation.

2000-12-13  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* FAQ: While working on the FAQ mirroring item, I discovered that
	we need a mirror command because "get" unwraps the tarfiles as a
	side effect, which is not nice. Mirror() will do nothing if source
	is a "file:" URL. It will probably understand force to override
	that. It will copy to ~/.cpan/sources but leave the file unopened
	and untouched. Backed out the FAQ item until we have that fixed.

2000-12-11  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* CPAN::Distribution::normalize: Did not work correctly for
	authors that have subdirectories in their CPAN directory. Was
	counting slashes, am now also checking against a regexp.

	* cpl: make completion work with "get".

	* CPAN::Shell::ls: Reject arguments not matching [A-Z\-] to
	prevent /.../ expansion which neither worked nor is considered
	useful.

	* CPAN::Shell::h: include ls command

	* variable naming: rename $date_of_03 and $last_time to uppercase
	counterparts. Globals must stand out visually.

	* FAQ: Adding "How do I set up a local CPAN mirror that does not
	contain things I'm not interested in?". Thanks to Paul Moore for
	asking the question (but see above, the article was removed for
	further consideration on 2000-12-13)

	* CPAN::Author::id: add a sanity check, first letter must be A-Z

2000-12-10  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* CPAN::Distribution::look: Protect against empty $dir and use
	safe_chdir instead of chdir.

2000-12-01  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* get: finished the treatment of the NFS racing condition that
	motivated many of the recent changes in get(). Thanks for
	reporting and heavy testing to Steffen Beyer.

	* Releasing as 1.59_51.

	* normalize: protect against the case when normalize is called
	without argument.

	* Thanks to Jeremy Wadsack who read the first sketch of the
	documentation of the programmer's interface and provided helpful
	comments and additions.

        * Declaring 1.58_93 as 1.59 and releasing as such to have a stable
        baseline again. 1.58_93 had been integrated into the development
        track of 5.7.0 with patch 7737 on 2000/11/18.

2000-11-30  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* CPAN::Distribution::get: removed a special case that was never
	documented and apparently never worked: when keep_source_where
	matched /^no/, we tried to delete the source again after an
	installation.

	* POD: documented expandany

	* CPAN::Bundle::inst_file: now takes the newest Bundle definition
	file it finds within @INC and ~/.cpan/Bundle/. Sets INST_VERSION
	as side effect. CPAN::Bundle::inst_version calls inst_file.

	* CPAN::Distribution::uptodate: New method.

	* CPAN::Bundle::uptodate: New method. Thanks to Jeremy Wadsack who
	discovered that an uptodate method for Bundles was missing.

	* POD: Wrote at least the headlines for all public methods to make
	a second step at opening CPAN.pm for programmers.

2000-11-28  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* CPAN::Admin (CPAN::Shell::register): opened for XML, Tk, and Apache.

	* CPAN::Author::ls: include the author's ID in the listing to make
	copy&paste easier.

	* normalize: Allowed the special case "N/A ..." for bundles.

	* CPAN::Complete::cpl: made completion for bundles work on install
	et al.

	* localize: Encountered a C<Can't locate object method "new" via
	package "LWP::UserAgent"> although has_usable returned true. Could
	not find out the reason, so I wrapped it into an eval.

2000-11-23  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Sending as 1.58_94 to Steffen, no release to avoid confusion.

	* Due to a bug report by Steffen Beyer I added a whole lot of
	debugging statements to get in the hope, I can find a reason why
	his copy misbehaves under 5.00503.

	* CPAN::Distribution::get: Fixed indenting in get(). Added $! to
	the error messages there.


2000-11-22  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* CPAN::FirstTime::conf_sites: Added the option to download a
	MIRRORED.BY immediately even if the local one seems fresh enough.

	* POD: Lots of fixes spotted by John P. Linderman

2000-11-15  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Fixed an incompatibility with 5.00503 discovered by Ask B.
	Hansen.

2000-11-14  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* lib/CPAN/FirstTime.pm: MyConfig/Config buglet during
	site-picking and more verbosity for selecting good arguments for
	make (Thanks to Larry Virden for the report)

	* print_ornamented: Made shell output ornamenting dependent on a
	global variable $CPAN::Shell::PRINT_ORNAMENTING. It is and will
	stay a rarely used feature, so a global to turn it on and off
	seems appropriate. For the record: this does not do anything but
	colorize STDOUT and STDERR differently for debugging if all
	messages are wrapped correctly.

2000-11-11  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Admin: Made the machine name of PAUSE a constant.

2000-11-10  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* rematein: Enable dump of Author objects (was the useless silly
	message)

	* Two (temporary) global variables introduced:
	$CPAN::Tarzip::BUGHUNTING enables naughty code that may help track
	some bugs in Archive::Tar (already reported to SRZ). And
	$CPAN::Shell::ADVANCED_QUERY turns on a form of the query like
	    C<m userid=RFOLEY> or
	    C<m userid=~FOL> or
	    C<d cpan_userid=RFOLEY>

	But this syntax is highly experimental and WILL change, do not
	rely on it.
	
2000-11-09  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* CPAN::Module::userid: change to mean either CPAN_USERID from
	02modules or userid from 03modlist. Up to now it only meant the
	latter. As both are always identical, we could save some space by
	renaming CPAN_USERID to userid. --> Todo

2000-11-08  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* CPAN::Complete::cpl: Make completion work for locally installed
	bundles on the first try, not just the second.

	* CPAN::Complete::cpl: Make completion for authors work even when
	lowercase was typed in so far.

	* releasing as 1.58_90

	* CPAN::Module::name: was an alias for &cpan_file. That made the m
	command slow without any visible advantage. C<m /html-tree/> used
	to find the modules in the distribution HTML-Tree-XXX and now
	doesn't anymore. But this is misfeature as we have both <d
	/html-tree/> and <i /html-tree/> for that.

	* cpan_file: Fixed a bug that could instantiate an empty Author
	object.

2000-11-07  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* format_result: Add a summary line at the end how many items in
	the set.

	* print_ornamented: Moved the special-case for fullname to
	print-ornamented to be prepared for other UTF-8 fields besides
	fullname (Try with C<m Sub::Curry>)

2000-11-06  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Released as 1.58_57

	* CPAN::Shell::ls: I believe, ls is now fully functional, but it
	still needs some work on PAUSE to be perceived as bugfree. Thu
	left undocumented (but it's already useful as it is, even
	completion works; if you're interested: give it only authors as
	arguments).

	* CPAN::shell: Detect parse errors when Text::ParseWords fails
	without die()ing, like in C<d Documentum's>.

	* CPAN::Distribution::normalize: Try A/AC/ACALPINI/foo when the
	user says ACALPINI/foo. I have only tested for the C<rematein>
	family and the C<d> command so far. Need to find all places where
	the normalization is needed.

	* CPAN::Module::as_string: improved manpage parsing on files with
	CRLF in them.

2000-11-04  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Releasing as 1.58_56.

	* CPAN::Shell::local_bundles: Did not discover local bundle files
	if they were nested. Thanks to Ask B. Hansen for the report.

	* CPAN::Shell::ls: Started work on an ls command. Left
	undocumented because not yet finished. Needs mtime in CHECKSUMS
	file.

	* localize: Improved messaging when we try to download a
	compressed file instead of an uncompressed.

	* o conf: Made C<o conf -Module> to mean remove Module debugging
	from the current debugging settings. Handy when you turn on "all"
	and discover that Module is too noisy.

2000-10-29  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* FAQ about readline: Thanks to Joseph Kewish
	<jkewish@thedrag.com> who knew the correct answer.

2000-10-28  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* untar: again change preference to tag+gzip to hunt down a bug in
	Archive::Tar.

	* Admin's register: Forgive when URI::Escape isn't installed yet
	and let it be installed while we're running.

2000-10-27  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Releasing snapshot as 1.58_55.

	* CPAN::Admin::register: do not run a get if the command line
	already contains more than one arguments.

2000-10-26  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Added documentation for CPAN::shell and term_is_latin.

	* CPAN::Author::fullname: convert to latin1 if
	$CPAN::Config->{term_is_latin} is set to true.

	* CPAN::Module::as_glimpse and CPAN::Shell::_u_r_common: enabled
	coloring of module names that are already registered in the module
	list. This feature bloat will have to go away in a future version,
	but for a while it might prove useful. The diffs between RCS 1.361
	and 1.362 should then be applied reversed. The feature bloat is
	only visible when the global $CPAN::Shell::COLOR_REGISTERED is
	set, no visible changes are made otherwise.

	* Added CPAN::Admin in an extra file. The subclass is for CPAN
	admins only. For others it is an instructive programming example.
	I consider the programming environment still alpha and need
	feedback on its usefulness. E.g. I consider it ugly that
	CPAN::Shell::expand and CPAN::instance have such a B<slightly>
	different interface. I hate it that testing C<$m->{RO}{something}>
	creates the RO slot. I'm unsure what one could make easier when
	expand() returns a list of objects instead of a single object.

	* cpl: made CPAN::Complete::cpl more flexible by assigning all
	commands to the global @COMMANDS and offering a fallback for the
	second word to modules and bundles when an unknown command is
	entered. CPAN::Admin takes advantage of this feature.

2000-10-25  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* shell: The C<$term||=> change of 2000-10-20 broke the
	re-detection of ReadLine for fresh installations. Fixed that again
	so that both ways are possible: disposing the Stub interface and
	re-using an interface that is better than Stub.

2000-10-21  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* CPAN::shell: Now takes two arguments, one is the prompt, the
	second is the default initial command line.

	* Released this snapshot as 1.58_51

	* hosthard: applied a patch by Michael Dean
	<sysmwd@blackhole.detir.qld.gov.au> to support wget.

2000-10-20  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* CPAN::Distribution::containsmods: Did not return a value, now
	returns the contained modules

	* CPAN::Distribution::get: chdir back to initial CWD

	* CPAN::anycwd: new routine replaces all occurrences of replicated
	two-line code

	* shell: chdir-ing back to initial directory at end of CPAN::shell

	* CPAN::exists: added a config loader because everything depends
	on it. Will have to identify other places that need it.

	* shell: Assignment of a readline interface to term now is a "||="
	rather than a "=" in case somebody calls shell multiple times.

	* Moved the call to read_metadata_cache from shell to
	CPAN::Index::reload so that (1) it isn't called so early and (2)
	programmers can enjoy its availability too.

	* CPAN::Config::commit: die when you can't write the config file.
	We did only warn, but it is more frustrating to repeatedly get the
	same questions asked than to get at least a good error message.
	Will have to catch some error conditions earlier.

2000-10-18  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* CPAN::Module::as_string: up to now the MANPAGE attribute was
	only generated for installed modules. Now we try to read the
	manpage headline if a get has been issued so that a build_dir
	exists. This is helpful for exploring CPAN without installing
	anything, e.g. when you have no or only slow access to a WAIT
	server.

	* Releasing as 1.58

2000-10-15  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* FAQ: two new FAQ items added: autobundle and readline

2000-10-07  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Setting Version to 1.57_68RC

	* POD: numbering FAQ items; rewording of FAQ item 6 about bundles;
	introduced FAQ item 7 about CPAN::Site.

	* CPAN::FirstTime::init: Making cache_metadata default to 1.

	* missing_config_data: Making cache_metadata a reason to rerun
	configuration.

2000-09-29  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* CPAN::DESTROY: Protected the call to $gz->gzclose with an if
	defined $gz. Thanks to abigail for reporting the bug, apologies
	that I'm also not sure if this fixes the cause, or just the
	sympton.

	* has_inst: 2nd warning for not having installed Net::FTP
	silencified with a global (Thanks to Anno Siegel for the
	suggestion)

2000-09-16  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* 1.57_67 is a release candidate.

	* FirstTime: rewording of the intro for the cache_metadata feature
	from experimental to beta. Leaving default to off. As it is still
	turned off, I do not add the feature to the "necessary" features
	in sub missing_config_data. Will do so when default changes to on.

	* untar: for running the pipe, the external programs gzip and tar
	are OK to use but for a pure uncompress I prefer to use our own
	method gunzip for maximum code reuse (fallback to external gzip is
	there anyway) and less use of system().

	* hosthard: after Jost has approved that the code now is much more
	defensive against the install-an-inexistent-distribution errors,
	now the funkyftp programs are disallowed to process C<file> URLs
	at all.

2000-09-12  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* get: userid "anon" if cpan_userid does not provide one.

	* 1.57_66 for the sole purpose of testing the error provoked by
	the old lynx version. Next version will disable lynx for file:
	URLs and thus will doubly guard against the bug.

	* untar and gtest: enabled gtest with Compress::Zlib again, now
	with a test if the file size and buffer size are equal. In that
	case gtest returns false. untar now also uses gtest ahead of
	decompression to catch the error condition provoked by

          DB<5> x system "echo -n | /bin/tar xvf -"
        0  0

	The fact that tar returns TRUE on zero byte input could lead us to
	believe that we were doing a successful untar while in reality we
	had an uncompressed file that was completely bogus.

	Once again a big thank you to Jost Krieger who discovered this bug
	by feeding an inexistent distribution name to install() while he
	had an old version of lynx installed that did not discover the
	mistake and created the file as textfile containing an error
	message.

2000-09-11  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* gtest: disabled Compress::Zlib because it seems to offer no
	method to test if a file is compressed or not. If a file was not
	compressed, it happily treats it "as expected" setting no error. I
	was so sure that I tested this when it was introduced. We really
	need a test harness.

	* get: New instance variable had_no_makefile_pl

	* get: New instance variable was_uncompressed to later use it for
	heuristics if we're on the wrong track.

	* If we write a Makefile.PL on our own, we now choose the NAME
	parameter more carefully.

	* Ask user if he wants to proceed if the CHECKSUM file does not
	contain data about a downloded file.

	* hosthard: Skip "file" URLs

	* hosthardest: eliminated unused code for is_reachable

2000-09-10  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Tarball 1.57_65 (63 and 64 were not uploaded because I found
	errors during testing)

	* Bundle::inst_file: cleanup

	* unsat_prereq: decision to accept any installed version if
	PREREQ_PM says 0 or "undef" or undef.

	* follow_prereqs: broke this new method out of make because I want
	to repeat it in test. Repeating the check in test has the
	advantage that the user is reminded in time that still some prereq
	is missing.

2000-09-09  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Tarball 1.57_63.

	* rd_modpacks: do not let bundles be both bundles and modules
	anymore. Seems like memory bloat without any value.

	* reload: $last_time was set too early to a new value. It seems to
	have never manifested itself as a bug, but we now do the more
	correct localizing of the newer timestamp until we have read all
	three index files and then set the timestamp globally.

	* reload and read_metadata_cache: extend the index protocol to
	memory so that whenever a new protocol is introduced, the index
	gets loaded into memory asap.

	* instance vs set: moved the code that creates the RO pointer from
	instance to set and commenting the set method to have this side
	effect. This was the cause for a very difficult to diagnose bug.
	Thanks to Jost Krieger for discovering wrong content in Metadata.

2000-09-08  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* read_metadata_cache: More sanity checks.

	* _u_r_common: Added informational message about the number of
	matches in the database.

	* checklock: Checking $fh for undef. Thanks to
	Slaven Rezic for the report.

2000-09-06  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* lib/CPAN.pm (expandany): Distributions always had the habit to
	spring into existence, that means, people could say

	    test A/AN/ANDK/CPAN-1.57_60.tar.gz

	and got that thing downloaded if it existed on CPAN. Jost
	discovered this was broken. Fixed by replacing an expand() by
	instance() for distributions in expandany.

2000-09-05  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* undelay: After a jumpqueue we must not continue because success
	is unlikely. We set $self->{later} and the queuerunner calls
	undelay.

	* Bundle::inst_file: reviewed the code after Jost pointed out that
	it was suspectly formatted. Re-enabled the newer, better code that
	allows for multi-level Bundle package names.

	* Distribution::install: improved wording for the case where make
	failed (Thanks To Jost Krieger for spotting)

	* Bundle::as_string: CONTAINS was rendered as ARRAY(...)

	* expandany: added a scan for bundles as one could not install
	bundles immediately after program start but only after a "b"
	command (Thanks to Jost Krieger for the bugreport)

	* color_cmd_tmps: protection against deep recursion with a panic
	message.

	* expand: temporary introduced the "=" hack to eval code on the
	command line repeatedly. Now disabled again to prevent surprise.
	But as a reminder, I did run this command successfully before
	disabling:

	cpan> m '=length($self->id)==16 && substr($self->id,12,2) eq "::"'
	Module          Bundle::HTML::EP (N/A)
	Module	        Games::Cards::Tk (A/AK/AKARGER/Games-Cards-1.45.tar.gz)
	Module          Games::Worms::PS (S/SB/SBURKE/Games-Worms-0.61.tar.gz)
	Module          Games::Worms::Tk (S/SB/SBURKE/Games-Worms-0.61.tar.gz)
	Module          Lingua::Stem::En (S/SN/SNOWHARE/Lingua-Stem-0.40.tar.gz)

	* color_cmd_tmps: we're now coloring all objects when they enter
	the queue and we uncolor them when a command is finished. We just
	need a hook now to check if we really uncolored them all. What
	should the hook be? i ="$self->{incommandcolor}>0"

2000-09-04  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* color_cmd_tmps: rename the method reset_badtestcnt to
	color_cmd_tmps because it turns out to be the right place to reset
	sponsored_mods and maybe install_failed too, and if we mark them
	as dirty when used and as clean when reset, we might even succeed
	to have a tidy kitchen.

	* untar: backed out the preference towards Archive::Tar. It seems
	from reports I get and one hiccups I witnessed myself that
	Archive::Tar is not stable (sorry, no bugreport available). With
	the current state of CPAN.pm we cannot afford the additional risk
	from an external source.

	* Queue: backed out the change from string based queue to object
	based queue. I made some mistakes during transition and everything
	stopped working. This seemed the easiest way out.

	* reset_testcnt: introduced attribute badtestcnt for Modules,
	Bundles, and Distributions and method reset_badtestcnt to get rid
	of that counter before and after a command. During the command we
	inc the counter on unsuccessful make test commands. But we do not
	reset unknown dependencies. During 'make test' we up this counter
	if test fails and consequently do not repeat the testing. This
	should now safe much time if, say LWP tests fail and we have all
	of WWW::RobotRules, File::Listing, LWP, HTTP::Negotiate,
	HTML::Form, and LWP::Simple in a Bundle or reach the stuff via a
	dependency. Former versions would have repeated the testing ad
	nauseam. We now refuse on the second occasion and the user may be
	required to run something to finish building.

	* prereq_pm: split of method needs_prereq into unsat_prereq_pm and
	prereq_pm and letting the prereq_pm be stored in the object

	* cpl: added readme and dump to the list of supported keywords for
	completion

	* POD: documented the dump command in the debugging section of the
	manpage. Simplified the debugging section.

	* changed queue to work with objects instead of object IDs
	making it more natural to deal with them. Having the string
	representation there bit me several times in the past. At the same
	time shuffled some code from the queue-running loop to the
	queue-constructing loop thus catching errors before starting to
	work on the queue.

	* renamed dotdot_onreload to paintdots_onreload. Changed $redef
	from global to lexical.

	* lib/CPAN.pm (dump): made dump more userfriendly by adding a
	print statement, it is now a regular command to type C<dump
	Net::FTP>. But still left undocumented to augment comments from
	those who read the ChangeLog (That's you:)

2000-09-03  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* heavy re-structuring of Metadata in memory with high potential
	for breakage. All metadata are now split into a readonly and a
	read-write part and all objects have a pointer to the readonly
	part. The Metadata cache logic stores only the readonly part, so
	that no session-specific data will ever be found again in a future
	session.

	* AUTOLOAD: removed the autoloader support that was never used and
	seems not very intersting anymore with today's hardware. RCS: 1.325

	* removed all the %vd comments.

	* shortened all lines longer than 80 characters to make future
	patches better readable.

	* read_metadata_cache: Introduced protocol version number for
	Metadata.

	* removing a 'no strict' around the shell loop I do not recall the
	reason of.

	* lib/CPAN.pm: Folding two occurrances of use vars into one.

2000-09-01  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* lib/CPAN.pm (readable): After release spotted en error in the
	FAQ about not being root. Improved it a little, added another FAQ
	and gave it the VERSION 1.57_57.

	* Releasing as 1.57_56 as candidate for 5.7.0

	* missing_config_data and FirstTime: declared cache_metadata as
	not yet stable enough to turn it on per default. The reason is
	that I want the official external data from CPAN and the generated
	internal data from the current session clearly separated and this
	will take another working session that I cannot provide before
	5.7.0.

2000-08-31  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* POD: Added two FAQs about not being root and about the look
	command.

	* Replaced all backticks that were misused in documentation or
	dialogs as pretty left quotes by single ticks. I think it was
	Markus Kuhn who said so.

	* float2vv: added conversion of float to visible v-string for
	comparisons. Added some tests too.

	* MD5_check_file: Now die instead of print when the MD5 checksum
	mismatches.

	* untar and unzip: preferring Archive::Tar now that it works
	again. Adding extra security check by testing for absolute path
	and updir.

	* unzip_me: made it symmetrical to untar_me and added a few Signal
	checkers to both.

	* hosteasy/hard/hardest: now checking for $Signal and giving up in
	several places within the download loop. Thanks for the suggestion
	to Johan Vromans. I'd be ready to ask a question where to continue
	but it turns out to need careful wording because the loop is
	deeply nested: method, host, and within the methods LWP/Net::FTP
	or lynx/ncftpget/ncftp. Simple wording might cause more grief than
	just giving up.

	* localize: now setting $ENV for proxies if config has values for
	them. Thanks for the bugreport to Johan Vromans.

	* checklock: changed comment in the code

2000-08-30  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Applied 2 doc patches by Elaine and Jarkko.

	* Call to force now wants a first argument and this was not there.
	This was the reason why force DIST didn't work. Thanks to Jost
	Krieger for the bugreport.

	* install /xyz/ always needlessly went down the wrong path of
	trying to download "/xyz/". We're now catching this mistake
	earlier. Thanks to Jost Krieger for he idea.

	* changed the messages on a failure of make in test and install
	from "Oops" to something much more certifying. Thanks to Jost
	Krieger for the idea.

	* in vcmp short circuit for equality for speedup. Thanks to Jost
	Krieger for the idea.

2000-08-27  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Releasing as 1.57_53 without enough testing in the hope that I
	can test more the next days and maybe others can test a little.

	* CPAN::Distribution did not handle the force_update attribute
	correctly: it was never reset to false. Tried to fix that at the
	end of sub install and by limiting the scope of the force_update
	attribute to install, not to make anymore. Thirdly, the places
	where we leave the make, test or install by means of the signal
	handler, we also reset force.

	* Added a test for CPAN::Version::vcmp.

	* lib/CPAN/FirstTime.pm (init): corrected spelling (Thanks to Ask
	B. Hansen)

2000-08-25  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* rd_modpacks: track deletes on every reread, otherwise the
	metadatacache won't forget a thing ever.

	* Fixing Distribution->clean which was broken in that it set
	"force_update" leading to a mess when the user later tried to
	build this dist again. Thanks to Jost Krieger for spotting this.

	* Minor cleanups

	* CPAN::Version::readable now picks the head of the string

	* Storable::store => nstore. Thanks to Tim Jenness for the hint

2000-08-21  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Detected code duplication in CPAN::Shell::o and
	CPAN::Config::edit. Moved everything to CPAN::Config::prettyprint

	* Introduced package CPAN::Version which fixed and extended the
	support for v-strings. Old perls should not be affected at all and
	new perls should be protected against broken displays. New perls
	should also "do the right thing" as soon as the index files write
	"v1.0" for the literal v1.0 . Seems now feature-complete to me.
	Next thing to do is upgrade PAUSE and see what happens.

	* Applied a patch by Slaven Rezic to allow cacheing of the
	metadata from the index files via Storable.

2000-08-16  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Fixed numerous chdir that were not checked for success.

2000-08-13  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Thought about v-strings and their impact. Marked the relevant
	places in the code with "%vd" and applied some more or less simple
	changes to try a few things out. See Todo for a few memo
	sentences. At least diagnostics.pm is now reported fine as 1.0
	again.

	* Added support for Archive::Zip. The less external programs
	needed the better (?)

2000-08-11  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Changed all occurrences of $ in regular expressions to (?!\n)\Z
	which is a 5.004-save equivalent of \z. Thus patch 5406 to the
	perl core is re-integrated after it had been thrown out on
	2000-03-25.

	* isa_perl logic was duplicated in CPAN::Distribution::isa_perl
	and in CPAN::Shell::_binary_extensions. Made the latter use the
	former. Also extended the Distribution object with CPAN_COMMENT
	that can be set from the "02..." index file. If that comment
	matches /isa_perl\(.+?\)/, then it is a perl and $1 is the
	version.

2000-08-01  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Quick bugfix release 1.56. Thanks to Bruce Barnett <barnett
	birch.crd.ge.com> who showed me that I had forgotten debugging
	statements in the CPAN::Module::inst_version method reminding me
	also that unpatched 5.6.0 still produces warnings where it
	shouldn't. A quick fix is in and I release that as 1.56
	immediately.

2000-07-30  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Made completion output for a,b,d,m sorted. I have no idea when
	this sorting was lost or if it ever was there.

	* Set version number to 1.55 and going to release today or
	tomorrow after testing.

	* o conf was not prepared for hash refs.

	* Fixed propagation of error report during Bundle installation.
	Until now recursive bundles reported each bundle's faiures
	separately. Now callers in addition report what called bundles
	reported. This still doesn't seem perfect because the report can
	come too early but at least it is better now than it was and if
	one reruns the install command on a bundle, the report will be
	correct on the second run.

2000-07-29  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Applied a patch by Daniel Muiño <dmuino@afip.gov.ar> that was
	submitted to p5p where a my($msg) declaration was conditional.

	* Applied a patch by Anno Siegel who encountered a rarely seen bug
	in the download logic wrt. gzipped vs. not gzipped downloads. He
	cleaned up the variable names too in that area and I cleaned some
	more variable names after him. I believe, the variable names there
	were really inappropriate/misleading.

	* Following a suggestion by Michael G. Schwern, I made "ask" the
	default for prerequisites_policy. The old default of "follow"
	seemed to intimidate some new users, he said, and I agree, the
	default should be as little intrusive as possible while still
	being useful. "ask" seems the right choice for a first time user.

2000-06-23  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Replaced the undocumented old semantics of
	C<$CPAN::Dontload{"Compress::Zlib"} = undef;> in favor of the more
	natural C<$CPAN::Config->{"dontload_hash"}{"Compress::Zlib"} = 1;>
	and documented that.

	* Eliminated all occurrances of E<39> in the POD because
	pod2html has a bug that mistreats them and we do not really
	need them. Thanks to Daniel S. Lewart for reporting his.

2000-06-18  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* The "a" command now always converts its arguments to uppercase.

2000-06-17  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Introduced has_usable which is pickier than has_inst. Thanks to
	a report by Ian Phillipps who reported the Net::FTP/Net::Config
	connection: e.g. upgrading the processor deprecates Net::Config
	but not Net::FTP.

	* Applied a patch by Ben Tilly that changed the exception of
	isa_perl in CPAN::Distribution::make() from dying to warning so
	that bundles can continue if they contain core modules.

2000-04-15  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Thanks to "Magnus Ullberg" <mullberg@hotmail.com> who reported
	that configuring lynx with arguments actually works, so I
	documented it in the firewall section.

2000-03-28  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Change ${DISTVNAME} to $(DISTVNAME) in the Makefile.PL because
	nmake can't deal with the former. Thanks to David P. Mott
	<dpmott@sep.com> for the report.

2000-03-25  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Change all \z back to $ because \z is not in perl5.004_05.
	Thanks to Paul Schinder <schinder@pobox.com> for the report.
	Update: Later Ronald Kimball posted the better solution to P5P. He
	said "'\z' is equivalent to '(?!\n)\Z' and '\Z(?!\n)', which
	should work under 5.004."

2000-03-22  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Both Andrew Speer <andrew.speer@isolutions.com.au> and Michael
	G. Schwern <schwern@pobox.com> sent me a patch to the effect that
	version numbers in PREREQ_PM are honoured. Till now we installed
	the newest version for all PREREQ_PMs. I applied a mishmash of the
	two patches.

2000-03-20  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Found bug in the changes made on 03-14, the return value of
	&CPAN::Config::edit must be true.

2000-03-17  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* lib/CPAN.pm: no lib "."; since we do a lot of chdirs *and* do a
	lot of demand-loading, we need to prune the current directory. I
	wonder how everything could work so smoothely with the default
	INC path.

2000-03-14  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Editing the $CPAN::Config hashref had always tried to keep the
	type of hash values but that was errorprone. Switched to matching
	/list\z/ in the key instead.

	* Changing the urllist now triggers resetting of Thesite and
	Themethod. Maybe this needs a more general solution that resets
	any cache of any variable, but for testing the effect, I start
	with these two.

2000-03-11  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Added an FAQ section to the manpage. First 2 Fs deal with
	UNINST=1.

2000-03-10  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Updated the isa_perl checks to match 5.6.0 style.

	* The 02modules... file is now verified against its Line-Count
	header. The other index files need new headers to verify them.

	* Without any net access we did not make it through the
	configuration dialog. Fixed now.

	* Apply patches 4416, 4419, 5406 and 5409 from perl-5.6.0
	candidate.

2000-01-08  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Releasing 1.52 which is a pure bugfix release. New functionality
	is there but not used or not documented. Should be very stable.

2000-01-03  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Added a CPAN::Distribution::containsmods method that lists all
	modules within a distribution.

	* reload index now removes the whole old index. No, wait a minute,
	that's stupid. We want to keep session info. This is just a
	temporary measure to improve debugging. What we need is "wipe
	index" or some such and we need it for debugging only. [Backed out]

	* Text::Wrapping output of "o debug".

	* Fixed an uninitialized warning in CPAN::Shell::expand()

	* Protected call to close() in DESTROY with "if defined".

	* Allow "#" comments in a bundle definition section.

	* Text::Wrapping bundle install summary.

2000-01-02  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Overhauled the help page that gets output on "h", documented
	"get", undocumented "install r", it never worked (Thanks to Peder
	Stray <pederst@ifi.uio.no> for spotting)

	* ncftpget made to work again by changing directory before
	downloading (spotted aeons ago by Jarkko Hietaniemi)

1999-12-31  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Applied a patch by Paul Schinder <schinder@pobox.com> which
	corrects the computation of disk usage on the Mac.

1999-12-29  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Increased 30 to 60 in FirstTime where we "protect" against old
	MIRRORED.BY files and protect against endless loop if MIRRORED.BY
	remains older. Thanks for spotting the bug to James P. Goltz
	<goltz@nfr.net>.
	
	* Applied patch from Doug MacEachern that implements cvs_import
	without documentation.

1999-10-26  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Joe Schell <jschell@peakss.com> sent me a fix that disabled
	processing of bundles on NT.

1999-10-15  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Fixed a typo reported by Stas Bekman <sbekman@iil.intel.com>

1999-10-01  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Added a posting by Larry as a comment to rethink use of
	$SIG{__DIE__}

1999-08-01  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Applied a patch by 1999-06-13 Adrian Aichner
	<aichner@ecf.teradyne.com>
        (hosthardest): Initialize $netrcfile with $netrc->netrc.
        (untar): Attempt piping gzip output to tar irregardless of
	$OSNAME. Run commands separately in case of error.

	* Applied a patch from Ilya Zakharevich <ilya@math.ohio-state.edu>
	for unbuffering STDOUT and STDERR to get sane behavior in pipes.

1999-07-30  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Fixed a floating point issue that came up with DBD::ADO. See
	stringify comment in CPAN::Module::inst_version. Thanks to Lupe
	Christoph <lupe@lupe-christoph.de> and Michael G. Schwern
	<schwern@pobox.com> for the reports and Tim Bunce
	<Tim.Bunce@ig.co.uk> for the suggestion how to fix.

	* Fixed my email address in the manpage

1999-07-28  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* CPAN::Nox was broken, probably since 5.005's new AUTOLOAD
	behavior. Thanks to Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com> for the report.

1999-05-23  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* The force pragma no longer removes its record of prerequisites
	that it has already dealt with. This removes a potential for
	infinite loops when force is in effect.

	* Added a CPAN::InfoObj::dump method that can be used like so:
	! print expand("Distribution","JWIED/DBD-CSV-0.1021.tar.gz")->dump
	or
	! print expand("Module","DBD::CSV")->dump
	Not particularly userfriendly, thus left undocumented.

	* Added a check if Makefile.PL really wrote a Makefile.

1999-05-22  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Applied another patch by Ilya for return value of gzreadline
	with regard to -1: <19990522144647.A15778@monk.mps.ohio-state.edu>

	* Applied Ilya's patch for MD5_check_file for READ returning -1.

1999-05-08  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Improved error message if cpan_home can't be created (bug report
	by Jarkko Hietaniemi <jhi@iki.fi>)

1999-04-19  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Added a note about the correct format of file URLs

	* Added documentation to CPAN.pm for how to write cronjobs that
	watch The CPAN (thanks to Brian Moseley <ix@cp.net> for asking)

	* FirstTime: initialize urllist to be an empty array, because
	otherwise it could accidentally become a string

	* Renamed Changes file to ChangeLog and switched format to
	emacsens ChangeLog format


	Local Variables:
	coding:utf-8
	End:
