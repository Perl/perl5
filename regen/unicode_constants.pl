# DATA FORMAT
#
# Note that any apidoc comments you want in the file need to be added to one
# of the prints above
#
# A blank line is output as-is.
# Comments (lines whose first non-blank is a '#') are converted to C-style,
# though empty comments are converted to blank lines.  Otherwise, each line
# represents one #define, and begins with either a Unicode character name with
# the blanks and dashes in it squeezed out or replaced by underscores; or it
# may be a hexadecimal Unicode code point of the form U+xxxx.  In the latter
# case, the name will be looked-up to use as the name of the macro.  In either
# case, the macro name will have suffixes as listed above, and all blanks and
# dashes will be replaced by underscores.
#
# Each line may optionally have one of the following flags on it, separated by
# white space from the initial token.
#   string  indicates that the output is to be of the string form
#           described in the comments above that are placed in the file.
#   string_skip_ifundef  is the same as 'string', but instead of dying if the
#           code point doesn't exist, the line is just skipped: no output is
#           generated for it
#   first   indicates that the output is to be of the FIRST_BYTE form.
#   tail    indicates that the output is of the _TAIL form.
#   native  indicates that the output is the code point, converted to the
#           platform's native character set if applicable
#
# If the code point has no official name, the desired name may be appended
# after the flag, which will be ignored if there is an official name.
#
# This program is used to make it convenient to create compile time constants
# of UTF-8, and to generate proper EBCDIC as well as ASCII without manually
# having to figure things out.
