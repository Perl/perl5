 * A note on nomenclature:  The term UTF-8 is used loosely and inconsistently
 * in Perl documentation.  For one, perl uses an extension of UTF-8 to
 * represent code points that Unicode considers illegal.  For another, ASCII
 * platform UTF-8 is usually conflated with EBCDIC platform UTF-EBCDIC, because
 * outside some of the macros in this this file, the differences are hopefully
 * invisible at the semantic level.
 *
 * UTF-EBCDIC has an isomorphic translation named I8 (for "Intermediate eight")
 * which differs from UTF-8 only in a few details.  It is often useful to
 * translate UTF-EBCDIC into this form for processing.  In general, macros and
 * functions that are expecting their inputs to be either in I8 or UTF-8 are
 * named UTF_foo (without an '8'), to indicate this.
 *
 * Unfortunately there are inconsistencies.

=for apidoc Ay||utf8ness_t

This typedef is used by several core functions that return PV strings, to
indicate the UTF-8ness of those strings.

(If you write a new function, you probably should instead return the PV in an
SV with the UTF-8 flag of the SV properly set, rather than use this mechanism.)

The possible values this can be are:

=over

=item C<UTF8NESS_YES>

This means the string definitely should be treated as a sequence of
UTF-8-encoded characters.

Most code that needs to handle this typedef should be of the form:

 if (utf8ness_flag == UTF8NESS_YES) {
     treat as utf8;  // like turning on an SV UTF-8 flag
 }

=item C<UTF8NESS_NO>

This means the string definitely should be treated as a sequence of bytes, not
encoded as UTF-8.

=item C<UTF8NESS_IMMATERIAL>

This means it is equally valid to treat the string as bytes, or as UTF-8
characters; use whichever way you want.  This happens when the string consists
entirely of characters which have the same representation whether encoded in
UTF-8 or not.

=item C<UTF8NESS_UNKNOWN>

This means it is unknown how the string should be treated.  No core function
will ever return this value to a non-core caller.  Instead, it is used by the
caller to initialize a variable to a non-legal value.  A typical call will look like:

 utf8ness_t string_is_utf8 = UTF8NESS_UNKNOWN
 const char * string = foo(arg1, arg2, ..., &string_is_utf8);
 if (string_is_utf8 == UTF8NESS_YES) {
    do something for UTF-8;
 }

=back

The following relationships hold between the enum values:

=over

=item S<C<0 E<lt>= I<enum value> E<lt>= UTF8NESS_IMMATERIAL>>

the string may be treated in code as non-UTF8

=item S<C<UTF8NESS_IMMATERIAL E<lt>= <I<enum value>>>

the string may be treated in code as encoded in UTF-8

Note the gaps before several of the byte entries above marked by '*'.  These are
caused by legal UTF-8 avoiding non-shortest encodings: it is technically
possible to UTF-8-encode a single code point in different ways, but that is
explicitly forbidden, and the shortest possible encoding should always be used
(and that is what Perl does).  The non-shortest ones are called 'overlongs'.

Another way to look at it, as bits:

                  Code Points      1st Byte   2nd Byte   3rd Byte   4th Byte

                        0aaa aaaa  0aaa aaaa
              0000 0bbb bbaa aaaa  110b bbbb  10aa aaaa
              cccc bbbb bbaa aaaa  1110 cccc  10bb bbbb  10aa aaaa
 00 000d ddcc cccc bbbb bbaa aaaa  1111 0ddd  10cc cccc  10bb bbbb  10aa aaaa

As you can see, the continuation bytes all begin with C<10>, and the
leading bits of the start byte tell how many bytes there are in the
encoded character.

Perl's extended UTF-8 means we can have start bytes up through FF, though any
beginning with FF yields a code point that is too large for 32-bit ASCII
platforms.  FF signals to use 13 bytes for the encoded character.  This breaks
the paradigm that the number of leading bits gives how many total bytes there
are in the character. */

=for apidoc AmnU|STRLEN|UTF8_MAXBYTES

The maximum width of a single UTF-8 encoded character, in bytes.

NOTE: Strictly speaking Perl's UTF-8 should not be called UTF-8 since UTF-8
is an encoding of Unicode, and Unicode's upper limit, 0x10FFFF, can be
expressed with 4 bytes.  However, Perl thinks of UTF-8 as a way to encode
non-negative integers in a binary format, even those above Unicode.

=cut

The start byte 0xFE, never used in any ASCII platform UTF-8 specification, has
an obvious meaning, namely it has its upper 7 bits set, so it should start a
sequence of 7 bytes.  And in fact, this is exactly what standard UTF-EBCDIC
does.

The start byte FF, on the other hand could have several different plausible
meanings:
  1) The meaning in standard UTF-EBCDIC, namely as an FE start byte, with the
     bottom bit that should be a fixed '0' to form FE, instead acting as an
     info bit, 0 or 1.
  2) That the sequence should have exactly 8 bytes.
  3) That the next byte is to be treated as a sort of extended start byte,
     which in combination with this one gives the total length of the sequence.
     There are published UTF-8 extensions that do this, some string together
     multiple initial FF start bytes to achieve arbitrary precision.
  4) That the sequence has exactly n bytes, where n is what the implementation
     chooses.

Perl has chosen 4).
The goal is to be able to represent 64-bit values in UTF-8 or UTF-EBCDIC.  That
rules out items 1) and 2).  Item 3) has the deal-breaking disadvantage of
requiring one to read more than one byte to determine the total length of the
sequence.  So in Perl, a start byte of FF indicates a UTF-8 string consisting
of the start byte, plus enough continuation bytes to encode a 64 bit value.
This turns out to be 13 total bytes in UTF-8 and 14 in UTF-EBCDIC.  This is
because we get zero info bits from the start byte, plus
    12 * 6 bits of info per continuation byte (could encode 72-bit numbers) on
                UTF-8 (khw knows not why 11, which would encode 66 bits wasn't
                chosen instead); and
    13 * 5 bits of info per byte (could encode 65-bit numbers) on UTF-EBCDIC

The disadvantages of this method are:
  1) There's potentially a lot of wasted bytes for all but the largest values.
     For example, something that could be represented by 7 continuation bytes,
     instead requires the full 12 or 13.
  2) There would be problems should larger values, 128-bit say, ever need to be
     represented.

=for apidoc Am|bool|UTF8_IS_INVARIANT|char c

Evaluates to 1 if the byte C<c> represents the same character when encoded in
UTF-8 as when not; otherwise evaluates to 0.  UTF-8 invariant characters can be
copied as-is when converting to/from UTF-8, saving time.

In spite of the name, this macro gives the correct result if the input string
from which C<c> comes is not encoded in UTF-8.

See C<L</UVCHR_IS_INVARIANT>> for checking if a UV is invariant.

=cut

The reason it works on both UTF-8 encoded strings and non-UTF-8 encoded, is
that it returns TRUE in each for the exact same set of bit patterns.  It is
valid on a subset of what UVCHR_IS_INVARIANT is valid on, so can just use that;
and the compiler should optimize out anything extraneous given the
implementation of the latter. */

Recall that Perl recognizes an extension to UTF-8 that can encode code
points larger than the ones defined by Unicode, which are 0..0x10FFFF.

This macro evaluates to non-zero if the first few bytes of the string starting
at C<s> and looking no further than S<C<e - 1>> are from this UTF-8 extension;
otherwise it evaluates to 0.  If non-zero, the return is how many bytes
starting at C<s> comprise the code point's representation.

0 is returned if the bytes are not well-formed extended UTF-8, or if they
represent a code point that cannot fit in a UV on the current platform.  Hence
this macro can give different results when run on a 64-bit word machine than on
one with a 32-bit word size.

Note that it is illegal in Perl to have code points that are larger than what can
fit in an IV on the current machine; and illegal in Unicode to have any that
this macro matches
