release_schedule - Perl 5 release schedule

=head1 STABLE RELEASE SCHEDULE

This schedule lists the projected or historical development and
release schedules for the next, current and previous stable versions
of Perl.  Dates with two or more question marks will only be releases if
deemed necessary by the Steering Council.

=head1 DEVELOPMENT RELEASE SCHEDULE

This schedule lists the release engineers for at least the next
four months of releases of bleadperl. If there are fewer than
four months listed as you make a release, it's important
that you extend the schedule AND B<identify the next release engineer>.

Before adding a release engineer, you B<must> contact them and they
B<must> consent to ship the release.

When shipping a release, you should include the schedule for (at least)
the next four releases. If a stable version of Perl is released,
you should reset the version numbers to the next blead series.
