=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.20.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.18.0 release and the
5.20.0 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.16.0, first read
L<perl5180delta>, which describes differences between 5.16.0 and 5.18.0.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 More consistent prototype parsing

Multiple semicolons in subroutine prototypes have long been tolerated and
treated as a single semicolon.  There was one case where this did not
happen.  A subroutine whose prototype begins with "*" or ";*" can affect
whether a bareword is considered a method name or sub call.  This now
applies also to ";;;*".

Whitespace has long been allowed inside subroutine prototypes, so
C<sub( $ $ )> is equivalent to C<sub($$)>, but until now it was stripped
when the subroutine was parsed.  Hence, whitespace was I<not> allowed in
prototypes set by C<Scalar::Util::set_prototype>.  Now it is permitted,
and the parser no longer strips whitespace.  This means
C<prototype &mysub> returns the original prototype, whitespace and all.

=head2 B<-F> now implies B<-a> and B<-a> implies B<-n>

Previously B<-F> without B<-a> was a no-op, and B<-a> without B<-n> or B<-p>
was a no-op, with this change, if you supply B<-F> then both B<-a> and B<-n>
are implied and if you supply B<-a> then B<-n> is implied.

You can still use B<-p> for its extra behaviour. [perl #116190]

=head1 Security

=head2 Avoid possible read of free()d memory during parsing

It was possible that free()d memory could be read during parsing in the unusual
circumstance of the Perl program ending with a heredoc and the last line of the
file on disk having no terminating newline character.  This has now been fixed.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Most regex engine global state eliminated

As part of this series of fixes it was necessary to change the API of
Perl_re_intuit_start().  See L</Internal Changes> for more.

=head2 Locale decimal point character no longer leaks outside of S<C<use locale>> scope

This is actually a bug fix, but some code has come to rely on the bug
being present, so this change is listed here.  The current locale that
the program is running under is not supposed to be visible to Perl code
except within the scope of a S<C<use locale>>.  However, until now under
certain circumstances, the character used for a decimal point (often a
comma) leaked outside the scope.  If your code is affected by this
change, simply add a S<C<use locale>>.

=head1 Deprecations

The C</\C/> regular expression character class is deprecated. From perl
5.22 onwards it will generate a warning, and from perl 5.24 onwards it
will be a regular expression compiler error. If you need to examine the
individual bytes that make up a UTF8-encoded character, then use
C<utf8::encode()> on the string (or a copy) first.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=item *

Perl has a new copy-on-write mechanism that avoids the need to copy the
internal string buffer when assigning from one scalar to another. This
makes copying large strings appear much faster.  Modifying one of the two
(or more) strings after an assignment will force a copy internally. This
makes it unnecessary to pass strings by reference for efficiency.

This feature was already available in 5.18.0, but wasn't enabled by
default. It is the default now, and so you no longer need build perl with
the F<Configure> argument:

    -Accflags=PERL_NEW_COPY_ON_WRITE

It can be disabled (for now) in a perl build with:

    -Accflags=PERL_NO_COW

=item *

Precomputed hash values are now used in more places during method lookup.

Under rare circumstances, one could get a "Can't coerce readonly REF to

alternate error message has been removed.

"Ambiguous use of * resolved as operator *": This and similar warnings
about "%" and "&" used to occur in some circumstances where there was no
operator of the type cited, so the warning was completely wrong.  This has
been fixed [perl #117535, #76910].

=item *

Warnings about malformed subroutine prototypes are now more consistent in
how the prototypes are rendered.  Some of these warnings would truncate
prototypes containing nulls.  In other cases one warning would suppress
another.  The warning about illegal characters in prototypes no longer says
"after '_'" if the bad character came before the underscore.

It is provided as part of the source distribution but not installed because
it is not self-contained as it relies on being run from within a git
checkout. Note also that it makes no attempt to fix tests, correct runtime

=item MidnightBSD

C<objformat> was removed from version 0.4-RELEASE of MidnightBSD and had been

erroneously configured for C<a.out> rather than C<elf>.  This has been now
been corrected.

=item Mixed-endian platforms

The code supporting C<pack> and C<unpack> operations on mixed endian
platforms has been removed. We believe that Perl has long been unable to
build on mixed endian architectures (such as PDP-11s), so we don't think
that this change will affect any platforms which are able to build v5.18.0.

=item Windows

The BUILD_STATIC and ALL_STATIC makefile options for linking some or (nearly)
all extensions statically (into perl519.dll, and into a separate
perl-static.exe too) were broken for MinGW builds. This has now been fixed.

The ALL_STATIC option has also been improved to include the Encode and Win32

    ucheck.valgrind utest utest.third utest.utf16 utest.valgrind

It's still possible to run the relevant commands by "hand" - no underlying
functionality has been removed.

=item *

It is now possible to keep Perl from initializing locale handling.
For the most part, Perl doesn't pay attention to locale.  (See
L<perllocale>.)  Nonetheless, until now, on startup, it has always
initialized locale handling to the system default, just in case the
program being executed ends up using locales.  (This is one of the first
things a locale-aware program should do, long before Perl knows if it
will actually be needed or not.)  This works well except when Perl is
embedded in another application which wants a locale that isn't the
system default.  Now, if the environment variable
C<PERL_SKIP_LOCALE_INIT> is set at the time Perl is started, this
initialization step is skipped.  Prior to this, on Windows platforms,
the only workaround for this deficiency was to use a hacked-up copy of
internal Perl code.  Applications that need to use older Perls can
discover if the embedded Perl they are using needs the workaround by
testing that the C preprocessor symbol C<HAS_SKIP_LOCALE_INIT> is not
defined.  (RT #38193)

=item *

C<BmRARE> and C<BmPREVIOUS> have been removed.  They were not used anywhere
and are not part of the API.  For XS modules, they are now #defined as 0.

=item *

C<sv_force_normal>, which usually croaks on read-only values, used to allow
read-only values to be modified at compile time.  This has been changed to
croak on read-only values regardless.  This change uncovered several core
bugs.

=item *

Perl's new copy-on-write mechanism  (which is now enabled by default),
allows any C<SvPOK> scalar to be automatically upgraded to a copy-on-write
scalar when copied. A reference count on the string buffer is stored in
the string buffer itself.

For example:

    $ perl -MDevel::Peek -e'$a="abc"; $b = $a; Dump $a; Dump $b'
    SV = PV(0x260cd80) at 0x2620ad8
      REFCNT = 1
      FLAGS = (POK,IsCOW,pPOK)
      PV = 0x2619bc0 "abc"\0
      CUR = 3
      LEN = 16
      COW_REFCNT = 1
    SV = PV(0x260ce30) at 0x2620b20
      REFCNT = 1
      FLAGS = (POK,IsCOW,pPOK)
      PV = 0x2619bc0 "abc"\0
      CUR = 3
      LEN = 16
      COW_REFCNT = 1

Note that both scalars share the same PV buffer and have a COW_REFCNT
greater than zero.

This means that XS code which wishes to modify the C<SvPVX()> buffer of an
SV should call C<SvPV_force()> or similar first, to ensure a valid (and
unshared) buffer, and to call C<SvSETMAGIC()> afterwards. This in fact has
always been the case (for example hash keys were already copy-on-write);
this change just spreads the COW behaviour to a wider variety of SVs.

One important difference is that before 5.18.0, shared hash-key scalars
used to have the C<SvREADONLY> flag set; this is no longer the case.

This new behaviour can still be disabled by running F<Configure> with
B<-Accflags=-DPERL_NO_COW>.  This option will probably be removed in Perl
5.22.

=item *

C<PL_sawampersand> is now a constant.  The switch this variable provided
(to enable/disable the pre-match copy depending on whether C<$&> had been
seen) has been removed and replaced with copy-on-write, eliminating a few
bugs.

The previous behaviour can still be enabled by running F<Configure> with
B<-Accflags=-DPERL_SAWAMPERSAND>.

=item *

The functions C<my_swap>, C<my_htonl> and C<my_ntohl> have been removed.
It is unclear why these functions were ever marked as I<A>, part of the
API. XS code can't call them directly, as it can't rely on them being
compiled. Unsurprisingly, no code on CPAN references them.

=item *

The signature of the C<Perl_re_intuit_start()> regex function has changed;
the function pointer C<intuit> in the regex engine plugin structure
has also changed accordingly. A new parameter, C<strbeg> has been added;
this has the same meaning as the same-named parameter in
C<Perl_regexec_flags>. Previously intuit would try to guess the start of
the string from the passed SV (if any), and would sometimes get it wrong
(e.g. with an overloaded SV).

=item *

XS code may use various macros to change the case of a character or code
point (for example C<toLOWER_utf8()>).  Only a couple of these were
documented until now;
and now they should be used in preference to calling the underlying
functions.  See L<perlapi/Character case changing>.

=item *

The code dealt rather inconsistently with uids and gids. Some
places assumed that they could be safely stored in UVs, others
in IVs, others in ints. Four new macros are introduced:
SvUID(), sv_setuid(), SvGID(), and sv_setgid()

=item *

C<sv_pos_b2u_flags> has been added to the API.  It is similar to C<sv_pos_b2u>,
but supports long strings on 64-bit platforms.

=item *

C<PL_exit_flags> can now be used by perl embedders or other XS code to have
perl C<warn> or C<abort> on an attempted exit. [perl #52000]

=item *

The OP allocation code now returns correctly aligned memory in all cases
for C<struct pmop>. Previously it could return memory only aligned to a
4-byte boundary, which is not correct for an ithreads build with 64 bit IVs
on some 32 bit platforms. Notably, this caused the build to fail completely
on sparc GNU/Linux. [RT #118055]

=item *

The debugger's C<man> command been fixed. It was broken in the v5.18.0
release. The C<man> command is aliased to the names C<doc> and C<perldoc> -
all now work again.

=item *

C<@_> is now correctly visible in the debugger, fixing a regression
introduced in v5.18.0's debugger. [RT #118169]

=item *

Evaluating large hashes in scalar context is now much faster, as the number
of used chains in the hash is now cached for larger hashes. Smaller hashes
continue not to store it and calculate it when needed, as this saves one IV.
That would be 1 IV overhead for every object built from a hash. [RT #114576]

=item *

Fixed a small number of regexp constructions that could either fail to
match or crash perl when the string being matched against was
allocated above the 2GB line on 32-bit systems. [RT #118175]

=item *

Perl v5.16 inadvertently introduced a bug whereby calls to XSUBs that were
not visible at compile time were treated as lvalues and could be assigned
to, even when the subroutine was not an lvalue sub.  This has been fixed.
[RT #117947]

=item *

In Perl v5.18.0 dualvars that had an empty string for the string part but a
non-zero number for the number part starting being treated as true.  In
previous versions they were treated as false, the string representation
taking precedeence.  The old behaviour has been restored. [RT #118159]

=item *

Since Perl v5.12, inlining of constants that override built-in keywords of
the same name had countermanded C<use subs>, causing subsequent mentions of
the constant to use the built-in keyword instead.  This has been fixed.

=item *

Lexical constants (C<my sub a() { 42 }>) no longer crash when inlined.

=item *

Parameter prototypes attached to lexical subroutines are now respected when
compiling sub calls without parentheses.  Previously, the prototypes were
honoured only for calls I<with> parentheses. [RT #116735]

Syntax errors in lexical subroutines in combination with calls to the same
subroutines no longer cause crashes at compile time.

=item *

Deep recursion warnings no longer crash lexical subroutines. [RT #118521]

The warning produced by C<-l $handle> now applies to IO refs and globs, not
just to glob refs.  That warning is also now UTF8-clean. [RT #117595]

C<(?[...])> now allows interpolation of precompiled patterns consisting of
C<(?[...])> with bracketed character classes inside (C<$pat =
S<qr/(?[ [a] ])/;> S</(?[ $pat ])/>>).  Formerly, the brackets would
confuse the regular expression parser.

=item *

The "Quantifier unexpected on zero-length expression" warning message could
appear twice starting in Perl v5.10 for a regular expression also
containing alternations (e.g., "a|b") triggering the trie optimisation.

=item *

C<delete local $ENV{nonexistent_env_var}> no longer leaks memory.

=item *

C<sort> and C<require> followed by a keyword prefixed with C<CORE::> now
treat it as a keyword, and not as a subroutine or module name. [RT #24482]

=item *

Through certain conundrums, it is possible to cause the current package to
be freed.  Certain operators (C<bless>, C<reset>, C<open>, C<eval>) could
not cope and would crash.  They have been made more resilient. [RT #117941]

=item *

Aliasing filehandles through glob-to-glob assignment would not update
internal method caches properly if a package of the same name as the
filehandle existed, resulting in filehandle method calls going to the
package instead.  This has been fixed.

=item *

C<./Configure -de -Dusevendorprefix> didn't default [RT #64126]

=item *

The C<Statement unlikely to be reached> warning was listed in
L<perldiag> as an C<exec>-category warning, but was enabled and disabled
by the C<syntax> category.  On the other hand, the C<exec> category
controlled its fatal-ness.  It is now entirely handled by the C<exec>
category.

=item *

The "Replacement list is longer that search list" warning for C<tr///> and
C<y///> no longer occurs in the presence of the C</c> flag. [RT #118047]

=item *

Perl v5.18 inadvertently introduced a bug whereby interpolating mixed up-
and down-graded UTF-8 strings in a regex could result in malformed UTF-8
in the pattern: specifically if a downgraded character in the range
C<\x80..\xff> followed a UTF-8 string, e.g.

    utf8::upgrade(  my $u = "\x{e5}");
    utf8::downgrade(my $d = "\x{e5}");
    /$u$d/

[RT #118297]

=item *

Stringification of NVs are not cached so that the lexical locale controls
stringification of the decimal point [perl #108378] [perl #115800]

=item *

There have been several fixes related to Perl's handling of locales.  perl
#38193 was described above in L</Internal Changes>.
Also fixed is #112208 in which the error string in C<$!> displayed as
garbage in many UTF-8 locales;
#118197, where the radix (decimal point) character had to be an ASCII
character (which doesn't work for some non-Western languages);
and #115808, in which C<POSIX::setlocale()> on failure returned an
C<undef> which didn't warn about not being defined even if those
warnings were enabled.

=item *

The dtrace sub-entry probe now works with lexical subs, instead of
crashing [perl #118305].

=item *

Compiling a C<split> operator whose third argument is a named constant
evaulating to 0 no longer causes the constant's value to change.

=item *

A named constant used as the second argument to C<index> no longer gets
coerced to a string if it is a reference, regular expression, dualvar, etc.

=item *

A named constant evaluating to the undefined value used as the second
argument to C<index> no longer produces "uninitialized" warnings at compile
time.  It will still produce them at run time.

=item *

When a scalar was returned from a subroutine in @INC, the referenced scalar
was magically converted into an IO thingy, possibly resulting in "Bizarre
copy" errors if that scalar continued to be used elsewhere.  Now Perl uses
an internal copy of the scalar instead.

=item *

Undefining an inlinable lexical subroutine (C<my sub foo() { 42 } undef
&foo>) would result in a crash if warnings were turned on.

=item *

Certain uses of the C<sort> operator are optimised to modify an array in
place, such as C<@a = sort @a>.  During the sorting, the array is made
read-only.  If a sort block should happen to die, then the array remained
read-only even outside the C<sort>.  This has been fixed.

=item *

C<$a> and C<$b> inside a sort block are aliased to the actual arguments to
C<sort>, so they can be modified through those two variables.  This did not
always work, e.g., for lvalue subs and C<$#ary>, and probably many other
operators.  It works now.

=item *

The arguments to C<sort> are now all in list context.  If the C<sort>
itself were called in void or scalar context, then I<some>, but not all, of
the arguments used to be in void or scalar context.

=item *

Subroutine prototypes with Unicode characters above U+00FF were getting
mangled during closure cloning.  This would happen with subroutines closing
over lexical variables declared outside, and with lexical subs.

=item *

In regular expressions containing multiple code blocks, the values of
C<$1>, C<$2>, etc., set by nested regular expression calls would leak from
one block to the next.  Now these variables always refer to the outer
regular expression at the start of an embedded block [perl #117917].

=item *

C<UNIVERSAL::can> now treats its first argument the same way that method
calls do: Typeglobs and glob references with non-empty IO slots are treated
as handles, and strings are treated as filehandles, rather than packages,
if a handle with that name exists [perl #113932].

=item *

Method calls on typeglobs (e.g., C<< *ARGV->getline >>) used to stringify
the typeglob and then look it up again.  Combined with changes in Perl
5.18.0, this allowed C<< *foo->bar >> to call methods on the "foo" package
(like C<< foo->bar >>).  In some cases it could cause the method to be
called on the wrong handle.  Now a typeglob argument is treated as a
handle (just like C<< (\*foo)->bar >>), or, if its IO slot is empty, an
error is raised.

=item *

Under copy-on-write builds (the default as of 5.19.1) C<< ${'_<-e'}[0] >>
no longer gets mangled.  This is the first line of input saved for the
debugger's use for one-liners [perl #118627].

=item *

Assigning a vstring to a tied variable or to a subroutine argument aliased
to a nonexistent hash or array element now works, without flattening the
vstring into a regular string.

=item *

C<pos>, C<tie>, C<tied> and C<untie> did not work
properly on subroutine arguments aliased to nonexistent
hash and array elements [perl #77814, #27010].

=item *

The C<< => >> fat arrow operator can now quote built-in keywords even if it
occurs on the next line, making it consistent with how it treats other
barewords.

=item *

Autovivifying a subroutine stub via C<\&$glob> started causing crashes in Perl
5.18.0 if the $glob was merely a copy of a real glob, i.e., a scalar that had
had a glob assigned to it.  This has been fixed. [perl #119051]

=item *

On 64-bit platforms C<pos> can now be set to a value higher than 2**31-1.
[perl #72766]

=item *

Perl used to leak an implementation detail when it came to referencing the
return values of certain operators.  C<for ($a+$b) { warn \$_; warn \$_ }> used
to display two different memory addresses, because the C<\> operator was
copying the variable.  Under threaded builds, it would also happen for
constants (C<for(1) { ... }>).  This has been fixed. [perl #21979, #78194,
#89188, #109746, #114838, #115388]

=item *

The range operator C<..> was returning the same modifiable scalars with each
call, unless it was the only thing in a C<foreach> loop header.  This meant
that changes to values within the list returned would be visible the next time
the operator was executed. [perl #3105]

=item *

Constant folding and subroutine inlining no longer cause operations that would
normally return new modifiable scalars to return read-only values instead.

=item *

Closures of the form C<sub () { $some_variable }> are no longer inlined,
causing changes to the variable to be ignored by callers of the subroutine.
[perl #79908]

=item *

Return values of certain operators such as C<ref> would sometimes be shared
between recursive calls to the same subroutine, causing the inner call to
modify the value returned by C<ref> in the outer call.  This has been fixed.

=item *

C<__PACKAGE__> and constants returning a package name or hash key are now
consistently read-only.  In various previous Perl releases, they have become
mutable under certain circumstances.

=item *

C</$qr/p> was broken in Perl 5.18.0; the C</p> flag was ignored.  This has been
fixed. [perl #118213]

=item *

Starting in Perl 5.18.0, a construct like C</[#](?{})/x> would have its C<#>
incorrectly interpreted as a comment.  The code block would be skipped,
unparsed.  This has been corrected.

=item *

Starting in Perl 5.001, a regular expression like C</[#$a]/x> or C</[#]$a/x>
would have its C<#> incorrectly interpreted as a comment, so the variable would
not interpolate.  This has been corrected. [perl #45667]

=item *

On non-threaded builds, setting C<${"_E<lt>filename"}> to a reference or
typeglob no longer causes C<__FILE__> and some error messages to produce a
corrupt string, and no longer prevents C<#line> directives in string evals from
providing the source lines to the debugger.  Threaded builds were unaffected.

=item *

Enabling "used once" warnings no longer causes crashes on stash circularities
created at compile time (C<*Foo::Bar::Foo:: = *Foo::>).

=item *

Undef constants used in hash keys (C<use constant u =E<gt> undef; $h{+u}>) no
longer produce "uninitialized" warnings at compile time.

=item *

Modifying a substitution target inside the substitution replacement no longer
causes crashes.

=item *

The first statement inside a string eval used to use the wrong pragma setting
sometimes during constant folding.  C<eval 'uc chr 0xe0'> would randomly choose
between Unicode, byte, and locale semantics.  This has been fixed.

=item *

The handling of return values of @INC filters (subroutines returned by
subroutines in @INC) has been fixed in various ways.  Previously tied variables
were mishandled, and setting $_ to a reference or typeglob could result in
crashes.

=item *

The C<SvPVbyte> XS function has been fixed to work with tied scalars returning
something other than a string.  It used to return utf8 in those cases where
C<SvPV> would.

=item *

Perl 5.18.0 inadvertently made dereferenced regular expressions
S<(C<${ qr// }>)> false as booleans.  This has been fixed.

=item *

Perl 5.18.0 inadvertently made C<--> and C<++> crash on dereferenced regular
expressions, and stopped C<++> from flattening vstrings.

=item *

C<bless> no longer dies with "Can't bless non-reference value" if its first
argument is a tied reference.

=item *

C<reset> with an argument no longer skips copy-on-write scalars, regular
expressions, typeglob copies, and vstrings.  Also, when encountering those or
read-only values, it no longer skips any array or hash with the same name.

=item *

C<reset> with an argument now skips scalars aliased to typeglobs
(C<for $z (*foo) { reset "z" }>).  Previously it would corrupt memory or crash.

=item *

C<ucfirst> and C<lcfirst> were not respecting the bytes pragma.  This was a
regression from Perl 5.12. [perl #117355]

=item *

The use of C<\G> in regular expressions, where it's not at the start of the
pattern, is now slightly less buggy (although it is still somewhat
problematic).

=item *

Where a regular expression included code blocks (C</(?{...})/>), and where the
use of constant overloading triggered a re-compilation of the code block, the
second compilation didn't see its outer lexical scope.  This was a regression
in Perl 5.18.0.

=item *

Changes to C<UNIVERSAL::DESTROY> now update DESTROY caches in all classes,
instead of causing classes that have already had objects destroyed to continue
using the old sub.  This was a regression in Perl 5.18. [perl #114864]

=item *

All known false-positive occurrences of the deprecation warning "Useless use of
'\'; doesn't escape metacharacter '%c'", added in Perl 5.18.0, have been
removed. [perl #119101]

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
