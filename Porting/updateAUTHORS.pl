There are uncommitted changes in the working directory
$uncommitted_files
and your git credentials are new to us. We think that git thinks your
credentials are as follows (git may use defaults we don't guess
properly):
$props$extra
To resolve this you can perform one or more of these steps:

    1. Remove the uncommitted changes, including untracked files that
       show up in

            git status

       if you wish to REMOVE UNTRACKED FILES and DELETE ANY CHANGES
       you can

            git clean -dfx
            git checkout -f

        BE WARNED: THIS MAY LOSE DATA.

    2. You are already configured in git and you just need to add
       yourself to AUTHORS and other infra: commit the changes in the
       working directory, including any untracked files that you plan to
       add (the rest should be removed), and then run

            Porting/updateAUTHORS.pl

       to update the AUTHORS and .mailmap files automatically. Inspect
       the changes it makes and then commit them once you are
       satisfied. This is your option to decide who you will be known
       as in the future!

    3. You are already a contributor to the project but you are committing
       changes on behalf of someone who is new. Run

            Porting/updateAUTHORS.pl

       to update the AUTHORS and .mailmap files automatically. Inspect
       the changes it makes and then commit them once you are satisfied.
       Make sure the conributor is ok with the decisions you make before
       you merge.

    4. You are already an author but your git config is broken or
       different from what you expect, or you are a new author but you
       havent configured your git details properly, in which case you
       can use something like the following commands:

            git config user.name "Some Name"
            git config user.email "somewhere\@provider"

       If you are known to the project already this is all you need to
       do. If you are not then you should perform option 2 or 4 as well
       afterwards.

    5. You do not want to be listed in AUTHORS: commit the changes,
       including any untracked unignored files, and then run

            Porting/updateAUTHORS.pl --exclude

       and commit the changes it creates. This test should pass once
       those commits are created. Thank you for your contributions.

current commit) and then updates F<AUTHORS> and F<.mailmap> so all contributors
are properly listed.

 Options:
   --help               brief help message
   --man                full documentation
   --verbose            be verbose

 Commit Range:
   --from=GIT_REF       Select commits to use
   --to=GIT_REF         Select commits to use, defaults to HEAD

 File Locations:
   --authors-file=FILE  override default of 'AUTHORS'
   --mailmap-file=FILE  override default of '.mailmap'

 Action Modifiers
   --no-update          Do not update.
   --validate           output TAP about status and change nothing
   --exclude-missing    Add new names to the exclude file so they never
                        appear in AUTHORS or .mailmap.

 Details Changes
    Update canonical name or email in AUTHORS and .mailmap properly.
    --exclude-contrib       NAME_AND_EMAIL
    --exclude-me
    --change-name           OLD_NAME=NEW_NAME
    --change-name-for-email OLD_ADDR=NEW_NAME
    --change-email-for-name OLD_NAME=NEW_ADDR
    --change-email          OLD_ADDR=NEW_EMAIL

 Reports About People
    --stats             detailed report of authors and what they did
    --who               Sorted, wrapped list of who did what
    --thanks-applied    report who applied stuff for others
    --rank              report authors by number of commits created

 Reports About Files
    --files             detailed report files that were modified
    --activity          simple report of files that grew the most
    --chainsaw          simple report of files that shrank the most

 Report Modifiers
    --percentage        show percentages not counts
    --cumulative        show cumulative numbers not individual
    --reverse           show reports in reverse order
    --numstat           show additional file based data in some reports
                        (not needed for most reports)
    --as-list           show reports with names with common values
                        folded into a list like checkAUTHORS.pl used to
    --numbered          add rank numbers to reports where they are missing

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item C<--help>

Print a brief help message and exits.

=item C<--man>

Prints the manual page and exits.

=item C<--verbose>

Be verbose about what is happening. Can be repeated more than once.

=item C<--no-update>

Do not update files on disk even if they need to be changed.

=item C<--validate>

=item C<--tap>

Instead of modifying files, test to see which would be modified and
output TAP test output about the validation.

=item C<--authors-file=FILE>

=item C<--authors_file=FILE>

Override the default location of the authors file, which is by default
the F<AUTHORS> file in the current directory.

=item C<--mailmap-file=FILE>

=item C<--mailmap_file=FILE>

Override the default location of the mailmap file, which is by default
the F<.mailmap> file in the current directory.

=item C<--exclude-file=FILE>

=item C<--exclude_file=FILE>

Override the default location of the exclude file, which is by default
the F<Porting/exclude_contrib.txt> file reachable from the current
directory.

=item C<--exclude-contrib=NAME_AND_EMAIL>

=item C<--exclude_contrib=NAME_AND_EMAIL>

Exclude a specific name/email combination from our contributor datasets.
Can be repeated multiple times on the command line to remove multiple
items at once. If the contributor details correspond to a canonical
identity of a contributor (one that is in the AUTHORS file or on the
left in the .mailmap file) then ALL records, including those linked to
that identity in .mailmap will be marked for exclusion. This is similar
to C<--exclude-missing> but it only affects the specifically named
users. Note that the format for NAME_AND_EMAIL is similar to that of the
.mailmap file, email addresses and C< @github > style identifiers should
be wrapped in angle brackets like this: C<< <@github> >>, users with no
email in the AUTHORS file should use C<< <unknown> >>.

For example:

  Porting/updateAUTHORS.pl --exclude-contrib="Joe B <b@joe.com>"

Would remove all references to "Joe B" from F<AUTHORS> and F<.mailmap>
and add the required entires to F<Porting/exclude_contrib.txt> such that
the contributor would never be automatically added back, and would be
automatically removed should someone read them manually.

=item C<--exclude-missing>

=item C<--exclude_missing>

=item C<--exclude>

Normally when the tool is run it *adds* missing data only. If this
option is set then the reverse will happen, any author data missing will
be marked as intentionally missing in such a way that future "normal"
runs of the script ignore the author(s) that were excluded.

The exclude data is stored in F<Porting/exclude_contrib.txt> as a SHA256
digest (in base 64) of the user name and email being excluded so that
the list itself doesnt contain the contributor details in plain text.

The general idea is that if you want to remove someone from F<AUTHORS>
and F<.mailmap> you delete their details manually, and then run this
tool with the C<--exclude> option. It is probably a good idea to run it
first without any arguments to make sure you dont exclude something or
someone you did not intend to.

=item C<--stats>

Show detailed stats about committers and the work they did in a tabular
form. If the C<--numstat> option is provided this report will provide
additional data about the files a developer worked on. May be slow the
first time it is used as git unpacks the relevant data.

=item C<--who>

Show a list of which committers and authors contributed to the project
in the selected range of commits. The list will contain the name only,
and will sorted according to unicode collation rules. This list is
suitable in release notes and similar contexts.

=item C<--thanks-applied>

Show a report of which committers applied work on behalf of
someone else, including counts. Modified by the C<--as-list> and
C<--display-rank>.

=item C<--rank>

Shows a report of which commits did the most work. Modified by the
C<--as-list> and C<--display-rank> options.

=item C<--files>

Show detailed stats about the files that have been modified in the
selected range of commits. Implies C<--numstat>. May be slow the first
time it is used as git unpacks the relevant data.

=item C<--activity>

Show simple stats about which files had the most additions. Implies
C<--numstat>. May be slow the first time it is used as git unpacks the
relevant data.


=item C<--chainsaw>

Show simple stats about whcih files had the most removals. Implies
C<--numstat>. May be slow the first time it is used as git unpacks the
relevant data.

=item C<--percentage>

Show numeric data as percentages of the total, not counts.

=item C<--cumulative>

Show numeric data as cumulative counts in the reports.

=item C<--reverse>

Show the reports in reverse order to normal.

=item C<--numstat>

Gather additional data about the files that were changed, not just the
authors who did the changes. This option currently is only necessary for
the C<--stats> option, which will display additional data when this
option is also provided.

=item C<--as-list>

Show the reports with name data rolled up together into a list like the
older checkAUTHORS.pl script would have.

=item C<--numbered>

Show an additional column with the rank number of a row in the report in
reports that do not normally show the rank number.

=item C<--change-name OLD_NAME=NEW_NAME>

=item C<--change-name-for-email OLD_EMAIL=NEW_NAME>

=item C<--change-email OLD_EMAIL=NEW_EMAIL>

=item C<--change-email-for-name OLD_NAME=NEW_EMAIL>

Change email or name based on OLD_NAME or OLD_EMAIL.

Eg,

    --change-name-for-email somebody@gmail.com="Bob Rob"

would cause the preferred name for the person with the preferred email
C<somebody@gmail.com> to change to "Bob Rob" in our records. If that
persons name was "Daniel Dude" then we might have done this as well:

    --change-name "Bob Rob"="Daniel Dude"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program will automatically manage updates to the F<AUTHORS> file
and F<.mailmap> file based on the data in our commits and the data in
the files themselves. It uses no other sources of data. Expects to be
run from the root directory of a git repo of perl.

In simple, execute the script and it will either die with a helpful
message or it will update the files as necessary, possibly not at all
if there is no need to do so. If the C<--validate> option is provided
the content will not be updated and instead the tool will act as a
test script validating that the F<AUTHORS> and F<.mailmap> files are
up to date.

By default the script operates on the *entire* history of Perl
development that is reachable from HEAD. This can be overriden by using
the C<--from> and C<--to> options, or providing a git commit range as an
argument after the options just like you might do with C<git log>.

The script can also be used to produce various reports and other content
about the commits it has analyzed.

=head2 ADDING A NEW CONTRIBUTOR

Commit your changes. Run the tool with no arguments. It will add
anything that is missing. Check the changes and then commit them.

=head2 CHANGING A CONTRIBUTORS CANONICAL NAME OR EMAIL

Use the C<--change-name-for-name> and related options. This will do
things "properly" and update all the files.

=head2 A CONTRIBUTOR WANTS TO BE FORGOTTEN

There are several ways to do this:

=over 2

=item Manual Exclusion

Manually modify F<AUTHORS> and F<.mailmap> so the user detals are
removed and then run this tool with the C<--exclude> option. This should
result in various SHA-256 digests (in base64) being added to
F<Porting/exclude_contrib.txt>. Commit the changes afterwards.

=item Exclude Yourself

Use the C<--exclude-me> option to the tool, review and commit the results.
This will use roughly the same rules that git would to figure out what your
name and email are.

=item Exclude Someone Else

Use the C<--exclude-contrib> option and specify their name and email.
For example

 --exclude-contrib="Their Name <email@provider.com>"

Should exclude the person with this name from our files.

=back

Note that excluding a person by canonical details (that is the details
in the F<AUTHORS> file) will result in their .mailmap'ed names being
excluded as well. Excluding a persons secondary account details will
simply block that specific email from being listed, and is likely not
what you want to do most of the time.

=head2 AFTER RUNNING THE TOOL

Review the changes to make sure they are sane. If they are ok (and
they should be most of the time) commit. If they are not then update
the F<AUTHORS> or F<.mailmap> files as is appropriate and run the
tool again.

Do not panic that your email details get added to F<.mailmap>, this is
by design so that your chosen name and email are displayed on GitHub and
in casual use of C<git log> and other C<git> tooling.

Loosely based on the older F<Porting/checkAUTHORS.pl> script which this tool
replaced. Thanks to the contributors of that tool. See the Perl change log.
