vote_admin_guide - Perl Governance Vote Administrator Guide

=head1 Running a Steering Council nomination process

Announce the nomination period to the Perl Core mailing list.  Be explicit
about the end time.  Set a calendar reminder for yourself for when it's
time to close the nominations and begin the voting.

Remember that inactive Core Team members may not participate in the nomination
or voting process.  The governance document is clear that inactive members may
not declare themselves active when a vote is proposed, which includes the
nomination process.

If someone outside the Core Team is nominated, contact them to confirm that
they accept the nomination.  If they do, ask the Steering Council to add
them as a moderated member of the Perl Core list for the duration of the
election and invite them to offer a statement on their candidacy to the
list.

Before the end of the nomination period, remind everyone of the schedule
and share the current list of nominees to confirm you aren't missing
anyone.

At the end of the nomination period, notify the Perl Core list of the list
of nominees and set their expectations for when you'll be opening the
voting period.

=head1 Using CIVS

We are using L<Condorcet Internet Voting Service|https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/>
(CIVS), which is pretty easy to use, although it has a lot of options.

First, bookmark that link, but realize that there are no user accounts.
Whenever you create or participate in a poll, you'll get a unique URL, and you
need to save it to come back to what you were doing before.

=head2 Preliminary work

You'll need to complete these steps.

=head3 Get list of active Core Team member emails

This can be found in the F<Porting/core-team.json> file.

=head3 Remind Core Team members to opt-in their email address

CIVS has a required opt-in to send polls out to an email address. The active
Core Team members that would like to vote and haven't opted-in yet must use the
following link with the email address they have in F<core-team.json>:
L<https://civs1.civs.us/cgi-bin/opt_in.pl>

=head2 Running an election on CIVS

The following instructions describe steps to run an election.

=head3 Creating a poll

On the right sidebar of the CIVS landing page is a list of links, and the
first one is Create a poll.  Some of the things it asks for are simple:
what's it called?  Who is running it?  It asks for an email address, and it
has to work: that's where you're going to get all the links!

Note that "day and time you plan to stop" is just a text box.  It gets sent
to the recipient in their invitation to vote.  It does not schedule one
dang thing, so you better set yourself a reminder to close the poll on
time!  Also, remember to think about time zones!  (You are free to
selfishly pick your local time.)

The description box is limited HTML: you can put in C<< <p> >> and
C<< <b> >> and C<< <ul> >> and C<< <a> >> and some other basics.  Hit
"preview" whenever you want.  Also, you'll be able to see the email
before you send it to everybody.

The "names of choices" is line by line.  Blanks are ignored.  Again, use
preview.  Also, note that these will be presented to the voters in random
order, so the order you put the candidates doesn't matter.  (CIVS lets you
force the ordering, but we don't use that.)

The options you want are:

    * How many choices will win: 3
    * Private
    * Enable detailed ballot reporting: true
    * Enforce proportional representation: true
        Assume maximizing rank of their favorite choice: true

Leave all other options off.

Then you can create the poll.

=head3 Start the poll

You'll get an email linking back to the poll's control page.

B<BOOKMARK THE CONTROL PAGE!>

Don't lose that link or you won't be able to administer the poll and you'll
have to re-create it.

From here, you can double check your settings.  Some things, but not all,
can be edited.

If it looks good, click "start poll."  You'll get a success page and can
click "go back to poll control".

=head3 Check how the email looks

At the bottom, under "Add voters", enter your email address.  Click "add
voters."  You'll get another success screen and can again "go back to poll
control."

Meanwhile, you'll get another email, this one linking you to the voting
page itself.  Proofread the email.  Click the link. Proofread the page.  If
you want, cast your vote!

At this point, you probably either need to start over - because you can't
edit a poll once it's going - or you're good to proceed.   If you need to
start over, just close the poll (or not, but it seems polite to do so) and
start over.  Otherwise...

=head3 Send the poll!

This is the point of no return!  Once you send the poll to the whole team,
you'll look silly if you made a big mistake.  That's okay, you can survive
looking silly, but it's better to avoid it if you can.

Put all the email addresses for the team into the "add voters" on the poll
control page.  There should be as many of these as there are team members.
Double check!  It's okay if you enter your email address, again.  You won't
be allowed to vote twice.

Click "add voters."  It will take a little while.  (I think it does all the
email sending synchronously.)  When that's done, you can email the list to
say the ballot has been sent.

If you're told that some email addresses aren't authorized to vote, chase
down these Core Team members that haven't opted-in their email address.

=head3 Wait

Now you just need to wait for the end date.  Set a calendar alarm to remind
yourself.  Look at the poll control page once in a while to see how many votes
were cast.  Because votes can't be edited once cast, you could end the voting
immediately once 100% of ballots have been cast, but don't expect this will
actually happen.

=head3 End the poll

When it's time, go to the poll control page and click "end poll".  You'll get
dumped on a results page that will provide the three winners (and a bunch of
other data).  Use the "minimax" rule (the default).  Everyone else will be able
to access these results, so don't worry about copying anything but the winners.
Inform the group!

=head2 After an election

In addition to notifying the Perl Core mailing list of the results, open a
pull request to update perlgov.pod with the new Steering Council members.
If a non-Core-Team candidate won, also add them to the Core Team list.

Ask the outgoing Steering Council to:

=over

=item *

edit the Perl Core mailing list admins to match the incoming Steering Council

=item *

update the GitHub "steering" team to match incoming Steering Council

=item *

request that the Perl NOC update the perl-security list to include all incoming
Steering Council members (without removing outgoing members; the incoming Steering
Council will decide whether this is needed)

=back

Update this guide with any clarifications or new information that will help
the next Vote Administrator.

Relax and congratulate yourself!
