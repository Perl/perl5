# Code of Conduct

Development of the Perl 5 language is covered by the [Standards of
Conduct](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlpolicy#STANDARDS-OF-CONDUCT) in the
[perlpolicy](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlpolicy) document.  (See
[pod/perlpolicy.pod](pod/perlpolicy.pod) for source version.)

The overarching rule is that participants are expected to **be civil**.
It is not enough to be factual. You must also be civil.

The Standard of Conduct falls under the authority of the
[Perl Steering Council](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlgov#The-Steering-Council)
and covers activities on the perl5-porters mailing list, the
GitHub repository issue/pull-request tracker, and any other venues
directly organized on behalf the Perl Steering Council.

**NOTE**: The Perl Steering Council operates independently of
[The Perl Foundation](https://www.perlfoundation.org/) and other
Perl community organizations.  Consult their websites for information on
other community codes of conduct.
