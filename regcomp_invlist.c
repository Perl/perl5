/* This section of code defines the inversion list object and its methods.  The
 * interfaces are highly subject to change, so as much as possible is static to
 * this file.  An inversion list is here implemented as a malloc'd C UV array
 * as an SVt_INVLIST scalar.
 *
 * An inversion list for Unicode is an array of code points, sorted by ordinal
 * number.  Each element gives the code point that begins a range that extends
 * up-to but not including the code point given by the next element.  The final
 * element gives the first code point of a range that extends to the platform's
 * infinity.  The even-numbered elements (invlist[0], invlist[2], invlist[4],
 * ...) give ranges whose code points are all in the inversion list.  We say
 * that those ranges are in the set.  The odd-numbered elements give ranges
 * whose code points are not in the inversion list, and hence not in the set.
 * Thus, element [0] is the first code point in the list.  Element [1]
 * is the first code point beyond that not in the list; and element [2] is the
 * first code point beyond that that is in the list.  In other words, the first
 * range is invlist[0]..(invlist[1]-1), and all code points in that range are
 * in the inversion list.  The second range is invlist[1]..(invlist[2]-1), and
 * all code points in that range are not in the inversion list.  The third
 * range invlist[2]..(invlist[3]-1) gives code points that are in the inversion
 * list, and so forth.  Thus every element whose index is divisible by two
 * gives the beginning of a range that is in the list, and every element whose
 * index is not divisible by two gives the beginning of a range not in the
 * list.  If the final element's index is divisible by two, the inversion list
 * extends to the platform's infinity; otherwise the highest code point in the
 * inversion list is the contents of that element minus 1.
 *
 * A range that contains just a single code point N will look like
 *  invlist[i]   == N
 *  invlist[i+1] == N+1
 *
 * If N is UV_MAX (the highest representable code point on the machine), N+1 is
 * impossible to represent, so element [i+1] is omitted.  The single element
 * inversion list
 *  invlist[0] == UV_MAX
 * contains just UV_MAX, but is interpreted as matching to infinity.
 *
 * Taking the complement (inverting) an inversion list is quite simple, if the
 * first element is 0, remove it; otherwise add a 0 element at the beginning.
 * This implementation reserves an element at the beginning of each inversion
 * list to always contain 0; there is an additional flag in the header which
 * indicates if the list begins at the 0, or is offset to begin at the next
 * element.  This means that the inversion list can be inverted without any
 * copying; just flip the flag.
 *
 * More about inversion lists can be found in "Unicode Demystified"
 * Chapter 13 by Richard Gillam, published by Addison-Wesley.
 *
 * The inversion list data structure is currently implemented as an SV pointing
 * to an array of UVs that the SV thinks are bytes.  This allows us to have an
 * array of UV whose memory management is automatically handled by the existing
 * facilities for SV's.
 *
 * Some of the methods should always be private to the implementation, and some
 * should eventually be made public */
