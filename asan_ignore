# The pp functions used under 'use integer' shouldn't warn about
# integer overflow etc.
#
# Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any way to disable just specific
# errors (i.e. the integer overflow ones). The manual implies that you can
# suffix with =foo for a "tool-specific category", but neither =undefined
# nor =signed-integer-overflow worked.

# this function numifies the field width in eg printf "%10f".
# It has its own overflow detection, so don't warn about it
