I<Programming Perl, Second Edition> is a reference work that covers
nearly all of Perl, while I<Learning Perl> is a tutorial that covers
the most frequently used subset of the language.  You might also check
out the very handy, inexpensive, and compact I<Perl 5 Desktop
Reference>, especially when the thought of lugging the 676-page Camel
around doesn't make much sense.
