=head1 NAME

perl5335delta - what is new for perl v5.33.5

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.33.4 release and the 5.33.5
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.33.3, first read
L<perl5334delta>, which describes differences between 5.33.3 and 5.33.4.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 New octal syntax C<0oI<ddddd>>

It is now possible to specify octal literals with C<0o> prefixes,
as in C<0o123_456>, parallel to the existing construct to specify
hexadecimal literal C<0xI<ddddd>> and binary literal C<0bI<ddddd>>.
Also, the builtin C<oct()> function now accepts this new syntax.

See L<perldata/Scalar value constructors> and L<perlfunc/oct EXPR>.

=head1 Documentation

=head2 New Documentation

=head3 L<perldocstyle> has been added to F<pod/>.

This document is a guide for the authorship and maintenance of the
documentation that ships with Perl.

=head2 Changes to Existing Documentation

We have attempted to update the documentation to reflect the changes
listed in this document.  If you find any we have missed, open an issue
at L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.

Additionally, the following selected changes have been made:

=head3 L<perlfunc>

=over 4

=item *

L<msgsnd()|perlfunc/msgsnd> documented a length field included in the
packed C<MSG> parameter to msgsnd(), but there was no such field.
C<MSG> contains only the type and the message content.

=head1 Testing

Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and
changes in this release.  Furthermore, these significant changes were
made:

=item *

When testing in parallel on many-core platforms, you can now cause the
test suite to finish somewhat earlier, but with less logical ordering of
the tests, by setting

 PERL_TEST_HARNESS_ASAP=1

while running the test suite.

=head2 Platform-Specific Notes

=over 4

=item Windows

Windows now supports L<symlink()|perlfunc/symlink> and
L<readlink()|perlfunc/readlink>, and L<lstat()|perlfunc/lstat> is no
longer an alias for L<stat()|perlfunc/stat>.
L<[#18005]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18005>.

Unlike POSIX systems, creating a symbolic link on Windows requires
either elevated privileges or Windows 10 1703 or later with Developer
Mode enabled.

stat(), including C<stat FILEHANDLE>, and lstat() now uses our own
implementation that populates the device C<dev> and inode numbers
C<ino> returned rather than always returning zero.  The number of
links C<nlink> field is now always populated.

L<< C<${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT}> |perlvar/${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT} >> previously
controlled whether the C<nlink> field was populated requiring a
separate Windows API call to fetch, since nlink and the other
information required for stat() is now retrieved in a single API call.

The C<-r> and C<-w> operators now return true for the C<STDIN>,
C<STDOUT> and C<STDERR> handles.  Unfortunately it still won't return
true for duplicates of those handles.
L<[#8502]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/8502>.

The times returned by stat() and lstat() are no longer incorrect
across Daylight Savings Time adjustments.
L<[#6080]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/6080>.

C<-x> on a filehandle should now match C<-x> on the corresponding
filename on Vista or later.
L<[#4145]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/4145>.

C<-e '"'> no longer incorrectly returns true.
L<[#12431]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/12431>.

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

All C<SvTRUE>-ish functions now evaluate their arguments exactly once.
In 5.32, plain L<perlapi/C<SvTRUE>> was changed to do that; now the rest
do as well.

=item *

Unicode is now a first class citizen when considering the pattern /A*B/ where
A and B are arbitrary.  The pattern matching code tries to make a tight loop
to match the span of A's.  The logic of this was now really updated with
support for UTF-8.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

L<semctl()|perlfunc/semctl>, L<msgctl()|perlfunc/msgctl>, and
L<shmctl()|perlfunc/shmctl> now properly reset the UTF-8 flag on the
C<ARG> parameter if it's modified for C<IPC_STAT> or C<GETALL>
operations.

=item *

semctl(), msgctl(), and shmctl() now attempt to downgrade the C<ARG>
parameter if its value is being used as input to C<IPC_SET> or
C<SETALL> calls.  A failed downgrade will thrown an exception.

=item *

In cases where semctl(), msgctl() or shmctl() would treat the C<ARG>
parameter as a pointer, an undefined value no longer generates a
warning.  In most such calls the pointer isn't used anyway and this
allows you to supply C<undef> for a value not used by the underlying
function.

=item *

L<semop()|perlfunc/semop> now downgrades the C<OPSTRING> parameter,
L<msgsnd()|perlfunc/msgsnd> now downgrades the C<MSG> parameter and
L<shmwrite|perlfunc/shmwrite> now downgrades the C<STRING> parameter
to treat them as bytes.  Previously they would be left upgraded,
providing a corrupted structure to the underlying function call.

=item *

L<msgrcv()|perlfunc/msgrcv> now properly resets the UTF-8 flag the
C<VAR> parameter when it is modified.  Previusly the UTF-8 flag could
be left on, resulting in a possibly corrupt result in C<VAR>.

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.
