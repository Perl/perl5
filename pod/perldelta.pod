=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.27.4

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.27.3 release and the 5.27.4
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.27.2, first read
L<perl5273delta>, which describes differences between 5.27.2 and 5.27.3.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 In-place editing is now safer

Previously in-place editing would delete or rename the input file
as soon as you started working on a new file.

Without backups this would result in loss of data if there was an
error, such as a full disk, when writing to the output file.

This has changed so that the input file isn't replaced until the
output file has been completely written and successfully closed.

This works by creating a work file in the same directory, which is
renamed over the input file once the output file is complete.

Incompatibilities:

=over

=item *

Since this renaming needs to only happen once, if you create a thread
or child process, that renaming will only happen in the original
thread or process.

=item *

If you change directories while processing a file, and your operating
system doesn't provide the unlinkat(), renameat() and fchmodat()
functions, the final rename step may fail.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 [CVE-2017-12837] Heap buffer overflow in regular expression compiler

Compiling certain regular expression patterns with the case-insensitive
modifier could cause a heap buffer overflow and crash perl.  This has now been
fixed.
L<[perl #131582]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131582>

=head2 [CVE-2017-12883] Buffer over-read in regular expression parser

For certain types of syntax error in a regular expression pattern, the error
message could either contain the contents of a random, possibly large, chunk of
memory, or could crash perl.  This has now been fixed.
L<[perl #131598]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131598>

=head2 [CVE-2017-12814] C<$ENV{$key}> stack buffer overflow on Windows

A possible stack buffer overflow in the C<%ENV> code on Windows has been fixed
by removing the buffer completely since it was superfluous anyway.
L<[perl #131665]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131665>

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here.
There may well be none in a stable release.

[ List each enhancement as an =item entry ]

Slightly improved performance when parsing stash names.  [perl #129990]

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

L<I18N::Langinfo> has been upgraded from version 0.13 to 0.13.

C<RADIXCHAR> (always was returned as a dot, and the C<THOUSEP> (always
empty).  Now the locale-appropriate values are returned.

=item *

A new function, L<C<Perl_langinfo()>|perlapi/Perl_langinfo> has been
added.  It is an (almost) drop-in replacement for the system
C<nl_langinfo(3)>, but works on platforms that lack that; as well as
being more thread-safe, and hiding some gotchas with locale handling
from the caller.  Code that uses this, needn't use L<C<localeconv(3)>>
(and be affected by the gotchas) to find the decimal point, thousands
separator, or currency symbol.  See L<perlapi/Perl_langinfo>.

=item *

A new API function L<C<sv_rvunweaken()>|perlapi/sv_rvunweaken> has
been added to complement L<C<sv_rvweaken()>|perlapi/sv_rvweaken>.
The implementation was taken from L<Scalar::Util/unweaken>.

The internal stack usage checks introduced in 5.27.2 is now also done
by the C<entersub> operator when calling XSUBs.  This means we can
report which XSUB failed to allocate enough stack space.  [perl
#131975]

=item *

Parsing a C<sub> definition could cause a use after free if the C<sub>
keyword was followed by whitespace including newlines (and comments.)
[perl #131836]

=item *

The tokenizer now correctly adjusts a parse pointer when skipping
whitespace in a C< ${identifier} > construct.  [perl #131949]

=item *

Accesses to C<${^LAST_FH}> no longer assert after using any of a
variety of I/O operations on a non-glob.  [perl #128263]

=item *

The C<Copy()>, C<Move()>, C<Zero()> macros and their variants now
assert if the pointers supplied are C<NULL>.  ISO C considers
supplying NULL pointers to the functions these macros are built upon
as undefined behaviour even when their count parameters are zero.
Based on these assertions and the original bug report three macro
calls were made conditional. [perl #131746][perl #131892]

The in-place sort optimisation now correctly strengthens weak
references using the new L<C<sv_rvunweaken()>|perlapi/sv_rvunweaken>
API function.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the C<perlthanks> program:

    perlthanks

This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
