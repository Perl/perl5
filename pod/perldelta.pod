=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.25.10

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.25.9 release and the 5.25.10
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.25.8, first read
L<perl5259delta>, which describes differences between 5.25.8 and 5.25.9.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=item Windows

=over 4

=item *

Support for compiling perl on Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
(containing Visual C++ 14.0) has been added.

This version of VC++ includes a completely rewritten C run-time library, some
of the changes in which mean that work done to resolve a socket close() bug in
perl #120091 and perl #118059 is not workable in its current state with this
version of VC++.  Therefore, we have effectively reverted that bug fix for
VS2015 onwards on the basis that being able to build with VS2015 onwards is
more important than keeping the bug fix.  We may revisit this in the future to
attempt to fix the bug again in a way that is compatible with VS2015.

These changes do not affect compilation with GCC or with Visual Studio versions
up to and including VS2013, i.e. the bug fix is retained (unchanged) for those
compilers.

Note that you may experience compatibility problems if you mix a perl built
with GCC or VS E<lt>= VS2013 with XS modules built with VS2015, or if you mix a
perl built with VS2015 with XS modules built with GCC or VS E<lt>= VS2013.
Some incompatibility may arise because of the bug fix that has been reverted
for VS2015 builds of perl, but there may well be incompatibility anyway because
of the rewritten CRT in VS2015 (e.g. see discussion at
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30412951).

=head1 Internal Changes

XXX Changes which affect the interface available to C<XS> code go here.  Other
significant internal changes for future core maintainers should be noted as
well.

[ List each change as a =item entry ]

=over 4

=item *

The C<op_class()> API function has been added. This is like the existing
C<OP_CLASS()> macro, but can more accurately determine what struct an op
has been allocated as. For example C<OP_CLASS()> might return
C<OA_BASEOP_OR_UNOP> indicating that ops of this type are usually
allocated as an C<OP> or C<UNOP>; while C<op_class()> will return
C<OPclass_BASEOP> or C<OPclass_UNOP> as appropriate.

=item *

The output format of the C<op_dump()> function (as used by C<perl -Dx>)
has changed: it now displays an "ASCII-art" tree structure, and shows more
low-level details about each op, such as its address and class.

=back

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

XXX Important bug fixes in the core language are summarized here.  Bug fixes in
files in F<ext/> and F<lib/> are best summarized in L</Modules and Pragmata>.

[ List each fix as a =item entry ]

=over 4

=item *

Attempting to use the deprecated variable C<$#> as the object in an
indirect object method call could cause a heap use after free or
buffer overflow.  [perl #129274]

=item *

When checking for an indirect object method call in some rare cases
the parser could reallocate the line buffer but then continue to use
pointers to the old buffer.  [perl #129190]

=item *

Supplying a glob as the format argument to L<perlfunc/formline> would
cause an assertion failure.  [perl #130722]

=item *

Code like C< $value1 =~ qr/.../ ~~ $value2 > would have the match
converted into a qr// operator, leaving extra elements on the stack to
confuse any surrounding expression.  [perl #130705]

=item *

Since 5.24.0 in some obscure cases, a regex which included code blocks
from multiple sources (e.g. via embedded via qr// objects) could end up
with the wrong current pad and crash or give weird results. [perl #129881]

=item *

Occasionally C<local()>s in a code block within a patterns weren't being
undone when the pattern matching backtracked over the code block.
[perl #126697]

=item *

Using C<substr()> to modify a magic variable could access freed memory
in some cases.  [perl #129340]

=head1 Known Problems

XXX Descriptions of platform agnostic bugs we know we can't fix go here.  Any
tests that had to be C<TODO>ed for the release would be noted here.  Unfixed

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.
