=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.27.7

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.27.6 release and the 5.27.7
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.27.5, first read
L<perl5276delta>, which describes differences between 5.27.5 and 5.27.6.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2  The C<sprintf> C<%j> format size modifier is now available with
pre-C99 compilers

The actual size used depends on the platform, so remains unportable.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Over-radix digits in floating point literals

Octal and binary floating point literals used to permit any hexadecimal
digit to appear after the radix point.  The digits are now restricted
to those appropriate for the radix, as digits before the radix point
always were.

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Assignment to C<$[> will be fatal in Perl 5.30

Assigning a non-zero value to L<C<$[>|perlvar/$[> has been deprecated
since Perl 5.12, but was never given a deadline for removal.  This has
now been scheduled for Perl 5.30.

=head2 hostname() won't accept arguments in Perl 5.32

Passing arguments to C<Sys::Hostname::hostname()> was already deprecated,
but didn't have a removal date.  This has now been scheduled for Perl
5.32.  [perl #124349]

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if not applicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=item L<Locale::Codes> and its associated Country, Currency and Language modules

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here.
There may well be none in a stable release.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

L<Locale::Codes> has been upgraded from version 3.54 to 3.55

B<NOTE>: L<Locale::Codes> is deprecated in core and will be removed
from Perl 5.30.

L<threads> has been upgraded from version 2.19 to 2.20.
The documentation now better describes the problems that arise when
returning values from threads, and no longer warns about creating threads
in C<BEGIN> blocks.  [perl #96538]

=item *

L<Data::Dumper> has been upgraded from version 2.167_02 to 2.169.
Quoting of glob names now obeys the Useqq option [perl #119831].
Attempts to set an option to C<undef> through a combined getter/setter
method are no longer mistaken for getter calls [perl #113090].

=head2 Changes to Existing Documentation

We have attempted to update the documentation to reflect the changes
listed in this document.  If you find any we have missed, send email
to L<perlbug@perl.org|mailto:perlbug@perl.org>.

XXX Changes which significantly change existing files in F<pod/> go here.
However, any changes to F<pod/perldiag.pod> should go in the L</Diagnostics>
section.

Additionally, the following selected changes have been made:

=head3 L<perlapi>

The API functions C<perl_parse()>, C<perl_run()>, and C<perl_destruct()>
are now documented comprehensively, where previously the only
documentation was a reference to the L<perlembed> tutorial.

The documentation of C<newGIVENOP()> has been belatedly updated to
account for the removal of lexical C<$_>.

The API functions C<newCONSTSUB()> and C<newCONSTSUB_flags()> are
documented much more comprehensively than before.

=head3 L<perlop>

The general explanation of operator precedence and associativity has
been corrected and clarified.  [perl #127391]

The documentation for the C<\> referencing operator now explains the
unusual context that it supplies to its operand.  [perl #131061]

=head3 L<perlsyn>

The means to disambiguate between code blocks and hash constructors,
already documented in L<perlref>, are now documented in L<perlsyn> too.
[perl #130958]

=head3 L<perlfunc>

The documentation for the C<exists> operator no longer says that
autovivification behaviour "may be fixed in a future release".
We've determined that we're not going to change the default behaviour.
[perl #127712]

A couple of small details in the documentation for the C<bless> operator
have been clarified.  [perl #124428]

The description of C<@INC> hooks in the documentation for C<require>
has been corrected to say that filter subroutines receive a useless
first argument.  [perl #115754]

The documentation of C<use> now explains what syntactically qualifies
as a version number for its module version checking feature.

=head3 L<perluniprops>

For each binary table or property, the documentation now includes which
characters in the range C<\x00-\xFF> it matches, as well as a list of
the first few ranges of code points matched above that.

=head3 L<perlobj>

The documentation about C<DESTROY> methods has been corrected, updated,
and revised, especially in regard to how they interact with exceptions.
[perl #122753]

=head3 L<perlsec>

The documentation about set-id scripts has been updated and revised.
[perl #74142]

A section about using C<sudo> to run Perl scripts has been added.

=head3 L<perlembed>

The examples in L<perlembed> have been made more portable in the way
they exit, and the example that gets an exit code from the embedded Perl
interpreter now gets it from the right place.  The examples that pass
a constructed argv to Perl now show the mandatory null C<argv[argc]>.

=head3 L<perldebguts>

The description of the conditions under which C<DB::sub()> will be called
has been clarified.  [perl #131672]

=head3 L<perlintern>

The internal functions C<newXS_len_flags()> and C<newATTRSUB_x()> are
now documented.

=head3 L<perlgit>

The precise rules for identifying C<smoke-me> branches are now stated.

is equivalent to C<"In $name::s house">.  If you meant the former, put
a backslash before the apostrophe (C<"In $name\'s house">).

XXX Describe change here

Warnings that a variable or subroutine "masks earlier declaration in same
...", or that an C<our> variable has been redeclared, have been moved to a
new warnings category "shadow".  Previously they were in category "misc".

=item *

The deprecation warning from C<Sys::Hostname::hostname()> saying that
it doesn't accept arguments now states the Perl version in which the
warning will be upgraded to an error.  [perl #124349]

=item *

The L<perldiag> entry for the error regarding a set-id script has been
expanded to make clear that the error is reporting a specific security
vulnerability, and to advise how to fix it.

=head1 Internal Changes

XXX Changes which affect the interface available to C<XS> code go here.  Other
significant internal changes for future core maintainers should be noted as
well.

=over 4

=item *

XS modules can now automatically get reentrant versions of system
functions on threaded perls.

By saying

 #define PERL_REENTRANT

near the beginning of an C<XS> file, it will be compiled so that
whatever reentrant functions perl knows about on that system will
automatically and invisibly be used instead of the plain, non-reentrant
versions.  For example, if you write C<getpwnam()> in your code, on a
system that has C<pwnam_r()> all calls to the former will be translated
invisibly into the latter.  This does not happen except on threaded
perls, as they aren't needed otherwise.  Be aware that which functions
have reentrant versions varies from system to system.

XXX

=item *

Digits past the radix point in octal and binary floating point literals
now have the correct weight on platforms where a floating point
significand doesn't fit into an integer type.

=item *

C<exit(0)> in a C<UNITCHECK> or C<CHECK> block no longer permits the
main program to run, and C<exit(0)> in a C<BEGIN> block no longer permits
C<INIT> blocks to run before exiting.  [perl #2754]

=item *

The canonical truth value no longer has a spurious special meaning as
a callable.  It used to be a magic placeholder for a missing C<import>
or C<unimport> method.  It is now treated like any other string C<1>.
[perl #126042]

=item *

The C<readpipe()> built-in function now checks at compile time that
it has only one parameter expression, and puts it in scalar context,
thus ensuring that it doesn't corrupt the stack at runtime.  [perl #4574]

=item *

C<sort> now performs correct reference counting when aliasing C<$a> and
C<$b>, thus avoiding premature destruction and leakage of scalars if they
are re-aliased during execution of the sort comparator.  [perl #92264]

=item *

Perl's own C<malloc> no longer gets confused by attempts to allocate
more than a gigabyte on a 64-bit platform.  [perl #119829]

=item *

Stacked file test operators in a sort comparator expression no longer
cause a crash.  [perl #129347]

=item *

An identity C<tr///> transformation on a reference is no longer mistaken
for that reference for the purposes of deciding whether it can be
assigned to.  [perl #130578]

=item *

Lengthy hexadecimal, octal, or binary floating point literals no
longer cause undefined behaviour when parsing digits that are of such
low significance that they can't affect the floating point value.
[perl #131894]

=item *

C<open $$scalarref...> and similar invocations no longer leak the file
handle.  [perl #115814]

=item *

Some convoluted kinds of regexp no longer cause an arithmetic overflow
when compiled.  [perl #131893]

=item *

The default typemap, by avoiding C<newGVgen>, now no longer leaks when
XSUBs return file handles (C<PerlIO *> or C<FILE *>).  [perl #115814]

=item *

Creating a C<BEGIN> block as an XS subroutine with a prototype no longer
crashes because of the early freeing of the subroutine.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the C<perlthanks> program:

    perlthanks

This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
