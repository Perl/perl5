=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.25.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.25.0 release and the 5.25.1
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.24.0, first read
L<perl5250delta>, which describes differences between 5.24.0 and 5.25.0.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 require ::Foo::Bar is now illegal.

Formerly, C<require ::Foo::Bar> would try to read F</Foo/Bar.pm>. Now any
bareword require which starts with a double colon dies instead.

=head2 Unescaped literal C<"{"> characters in regular expression
patterns are no longer permissible

You have to now say something like C<"\{"> or C<"[{]"> to specify to
match a LEFT CURLY BRACKET.  This will allow future extensions to the
language.  This restriction is not enforced, nor are there current plans
to enforce it, if the C<"{"> is the first character in the pattern.

These have been deprecated since v5.16, with a deprecation message
displayed starting in v5.22.

=head2 Literal control character variable names are no longer permissible

A variable name may no longer contain a literal control character under
any circumstances.  These previously were allowed in single-character
names on ASCII platforms, but have been deprecated there since Perl
v5.20.  This affects things like C<$I<\cT>>, where I<\cT> is a literal
control (such as a C<NAK> or C<NEGATIVE ACKNOWLEDGE> character) in the
source code.

=head2 C<qr//xx> is no longer permissible

Using more than one C</x> regular expression pattern modifier on a
single pattern is now forbidden.  This is to allow a future enhancement
to the language.  This usage has been deprecated since v5.22.

=head2 C<NBSP> is no longer permissible in C<\N{...}>

The name of a character may no longer contain non-breaking spaces.  It
has been deprecated to do so since Perl v5.22.

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here.
There may well be none in a stable release.

[ List each enhancement as a =item entry ]

=item *

Bareword constant strings are now permitted to take part in constant
folding. They were originally exempted from constant folding in August 1999,
during the development of Perl 5.6, to ensure that C<use strict "subs">
would still apply to bareword constants. That has now been accomplished a
different way, so barewords, like other constants, now gain the performance
benefits of constant folding.

This also means that void-context warnings on constant expressions of
barewords now report the folded constant operand, rather than the operation;
this matches the behaviour for non-bareword constants.

=back

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

=head1 Utility Changes

XXX Changes to installed programs such as F<perlbug> and F<xsubpp> go here.
Most of these are built within the directory F<utils>.

=item *

Long lines in the message body are now wrapped at 900 characters, to stay
well within the 1000-character limit imposed by SMTP mail transfer agents.
This is particularly likely to be important for the list of arguments to
C<Configure>, which can readily exceed the limit if, for example, it names
several non-default installation paths. This change also adds the first unit
tests for perlbug. [perl #128020]

=back

=head1 Configuration and Compilation

XXX Changes to F<Configure>, F<installperl>, F<installman>, and analogous tools
go here.  Any other changes to the Perl build process should be listed here.
However, any platform-specific changes should be listed in the
L</Platform Support> section, instead.

[ List changes as a =item entry ].

=over 4

=item *

C<Configure> now builds C<miniperl> and C<generate_uudmap> if you
invoke it with C<-Dusecrosscompiler> but not C<-Dtargethost=somehost>.
This means you can supply your target platform C<config.sh>, generate
the headers and proceed to build your cross-target perl.  [perl #127234]

=item *

Builds with C<-Accflags=-DPERL_TRACE_OPS> now only dump the operator
counts when the environment variable C<PERL_TRACE_OPS> to be set to a
non-zero integer.  This allows C<make test> to pass on such a build.

=item *

When building with GCC 6 and link-time optimization (the C<-flto> option to
C<gcc>), C<Configure> was treating all probed symbols as present on the
system, regardless of whether they actually exist. This has been fixed.
[perl #128131]

=item *

The F<t/test.pl> library is used for internal testing of Perl itself, and
also copied by several CPAN modules. Some of those modules must work on
older versions of Perl, so F<t/test.pl> must in turn avoid newer Perl
features. Compatibility with Perl 5.8 was inadvertently removed some time
ago; it has now been restored. [perl #128052]

=item *

The build process no longer emits an extra blank line before building each
"simple" extension (those with only F<*.pm> and F<*.pod> files).

=head1 Testing

XXX Any significant changes to the testing of a freshly built perl should be
listed here.  Changes which create B<new> files in F<t/> go here as do any
large changes to the testing harness (e.g. when parallel testing was added).
Changes to existing files in F<t/> aren't worth summarizing, although the bugs
that they represent may be covered elsewhere.

Perl is now built with the C<PERL_OP_PARENT> compiler define enabled by
default. To disable it, use the C<PERL_NO_OP_PARENT> compiler define.
This flag alters how the C<op_sibling> field is used in C<OP> structures,
and has been available optionally since perl 5.22.0.

See L<perl5220delta/"Internal Changes"> for more details of what this
build option does.

=item *

Expressions containing an C<&&> or C<||> operator (or their synonyms C<and>
and C<or>) were being compiled incorrectly in some cases. If the left-hand
side consisted of either a negated bareword constant or a negated C<do {}>
block containing a constant expression, and the right-hand side consisted of
a negated non-foldable expression, one of the negations was effectively
ignored. The same was true of C<if> and C<unless> statement modifiers,
though with the left-hand and right-hand sides swapped. This long-standing
bug has now been fixed. [perl #127952]

=head1 Known Problems

XXX Descriptions of platform agnostic bugs we know we can't fix go here.  Any

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.
