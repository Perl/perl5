=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.25.9

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.25.8 release and the 5.25.9
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.25.7, first read
L<perl5258delta>, which describes differences between 5.25.7 and 5.25.8.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

=head2 New regular expression modifier C</xx>

Specifying two C<x> characters to modify a regular expression pattern
does everything that a single one does, but additionally TAB and SPACE
characters within a bracketed character class are generally ignored and
can be added to improve readability, like
S<C</[ ^ A-Z d-f p-x ]/xx>>.  Details are at
L<perlre/E<sol>x and E<sol>xx>.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

=head2 String delimiters that aren't stand-alone graphemes are now
deprecated

In order for Perl to eventually allow string delimiters to be Unicode
grapheme clusters (which look like a single character, but may be
a sequence of several ones), we have to stop allowing a single char
delimiter that isn't a grapheme by itself.  These are unlikely to exist
in actual code, as they would typically display as attached to the
character in front of them.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>

following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

=head2 Updated Modules and Pragmata

=over 4

=item *

L<XXX> has been upgraded from version A.xx to B.yy.

=item *

L<re> has been upgraded from version 0.33 to 0.34;

This adds support for the new L<C</xx>|perlre/E<sol>x and E<sol>xx>
regular expression pattern modifier, and a change to the L<S<C<use re
'strict'>>|re/'strict' mode> experimental feature.  When S<C<re
'strict'>> is enabled, a warning now will be generated for all
unescaped uses of the two characters C<}> and C<]> in regular
expression patterns (outside bracketed character classes) that are taken
literally.  This brings them more in line with the C<)> character which
is always a metacharacter unless escaped.  Being a metacharacter only
sometimes, depending on action at a distance, can lead to silently
having the pattern mean something quite different than was intended,
which the S<C<re 'strict'>> mode is intended to minimize.

=item *

L<B::Xref> has been upgraded from version 1.05 to 1.06.

=item *

If the C<-xnolibs> is available, use that so a F<dtrace> perl can be
built within a FreeBSD jail.

=item *

On systems that build a dtrace object file (FreeBSD, Solaris and
SystemTap's dtrace emulation), copy the input objects to a separate
directory and process them there, and use those objects in the link,
since C<dtrace -G> also modifies these objects.

=item *

Add libelf to the build on FreeBSD 10.x, since dtrace adds references
to libelf symbols.

=item *

Generate a dummy dtrace_main.o if C<dtrace -G> fails to build it.  A
default build on Solaris generates probes from the unused inline
functions, while they don't on FreeBSD, which causes C<dtrace -G> to
fail.

=back

You can now disable perl's use of the PERL_HASH_SEED and
PERL_PERTURB_KEYS environment variables by configureing perl with

=item *

New versions of macros like C<isALPHA_utf8> and C<toLOWER_utf8>  have
been added, each with the
suffix C<_safe>, like C<isSPACE_utf8_safe>.  These take an extra
parameter, giving an upper limit of how far into the string it is safe
to read.  Using the old versions could cause attempts to read beyond the
end of the input buffer if the UTF-8 is not well-formed, and ther use
now raises a deprecation warning.  Details are at
L<perlapi/Character classification>.

=item *

Calling macros like C<isALPHA_utf8> on malformed UTF-8 have issued a
deprecation warning since Perl v5.18.  They now die.
Similarly, macros like C<toLOWER_utf8> on malformed UTF-8 now die.

=item *

Calling the functions C<utf8n_to_uvchr> and its derivatives, while
passing a string length of 0 is now asserted against in DEBUGGING
builds, and otherwise returns the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER.   If
you have nothing to decode, you shouldn't call the decode function.

=item *

The functions C<utf8n_to_uvchr> and its derivatives now return the
Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER if called with UTF-8 that has the overlong
malformation, and that malformation is allowed by the input parameters.
This malformation is where the UTF-8 looks valid syntactically, but
there is a shorter sequence that yields the same code point.  This has
been forbidden since Unicode version 3.1.

=item *

The functions C<utf8n_to_uvchr> and its derivatives now accept an input
flag to allow the overflow malformation.  This malformation is when the
UTF-8 may be syntactically valid, but the code point it represents is
not capable of being represented in the word length on the platform.
What "allowed" means in this case is that the function doesn't return an
error, and advances the parse pointer to beyond the UTF-8 in question,
but it returns the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER as the value of the
code point (since the real value is not representable).

=item *

Under C<use utf8>, the entire Perl program is now checked that the UTF-8
is wellformed.  This resolves [perl #126310].

=item *

The range operator C<..> on strings now handles its arguments correctly when in
the scope of the L<< C<unicode_strings>|feature/"The 'unicode_strings' feature" >>
feature. The previous behaviour was sufficiently unexpected that we believe no
correct program could have made use of it.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.
