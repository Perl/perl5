=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.37.10

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.37.9 release and the 5.37.10
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.37.8, first read
L<perl5379delta>, which describes differences between 5.37.8 and 5.37.9.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Some C<goto>s are now permitted in C<defer> and C<finally> blocks

Perl version 5.36.0 added C<defer> blocks and permitted the C<finally> keyword
to also add similar behaviour to C<try>/C<catch> syntax.  These did not permit
any C<goto> expression within the body, as it could have caused control flow
to jump out of the block.  Now, some C<goto> expressions are allowed, if they
have a constant target label, and that label is found within the block.

  use feature 'defer';

  defer {
    goto LABEL;
    print "This does not execute\n";
    LABEL: print "This does\n";
  }

=head2 New regexp variable ${^LAST_SUCCESSFUL_PATTERN}

This allows access to the last succesful pattern that matched in the current scope.
Many aspects of the regex engine refer to the "last successful pattern". The empty
pattern reuses it, and all of the magic regex vars relate to it. This allows
access to its pattern. The following code

    if (m/foo/ || m/bar/) {
        s//PQR/;
    }

can be rewritten as follows

    if (m/foo/ || m/bar/) {
        s/${^LAST_SUCCESSFUL_PATTERN}/PQR/;
    }

and it will do the exactly same thing.

=head2 Deprecation warnings now have specific subcategories

As of 5.37.10 all deprecation warnings will have their own specific
deprecation category which can be disabled individually. You can see a
list of all deprecated features in L<perldeprecation>, and in
L<warnings>. The following list is from L<warnings>:

         +- deprecated ----+
         |                 |
         |                 +- deprecated::apostrophe_as_package_separator
         |                 |
         |                 +- deprecated::delimiter_will_be_paired
         |                 |
         |                 +- deprecated::dot_in_inc
         |                 |
         |                 +- deprecated::goto_construct
         |                 |
         |                 +- deprecated::smartmatch
         |                 |
         |                 +- deprecated::unicode_property_name
         |                 |
         |                 +- deprecated::version_downgrade

It is still possible to disable all deprecation warnings in a single
statement with

    no warnings 'deprecated';

but as of 5.37.10 it is possible to have a finer grained control. As
has historically been the case these warnings are automatically
enabled with

    use warnings;

=head2 %{^HOOK} API introduced

For various reasons it can be difficult to create subroutine wrappers
for some of perls keywords. Any keyword which has an undefined
prototype simply cannot be wrapped with a subroutine, and some keywords
which perl permits to be wrapped are in practice very tricky to wrap.
For example C<require> is tricky to wrap, it is possible but doing so
changes the stack depth, and the standard methods of exporting assume
that they will be exporting to a package at certain stack depth up the
stack, and the wrapper will thus change where functions are exported to
unless implemented with a great deal of care. This can be very awkward
to deal with.

Accordingly we have introduced a new hash called C<%{^HOOK}> which is
intended to facilitate such cases. When a keyword supports any kind of
special hook then the hook will live in this new hash. Hooks in this
hash will be named after the function they are called by, followed by
two underbars and then the phase they are executed in, currently either
before or after the keyword is executed.

In this initial release we support two hooks C<require__before> and
C<require__after>. These are provided to make it easier to perform tasks
before and after a require statement.

See L<perlvar> for more details.

=head2 Platform-Specific Notes

=item *

C<POSIX::dup2> no longer creates broken sockets. [L<GH #20920|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/20920>]

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

Added C<SAVERCPV()> and C<SAVEFREERCPV()> for better support for working
with C<RCPV> (reference counted string/pointer value) structures which
currently are used in opcodes to share filename and warning bit data in
a memory efficient manner.

=item *

Added C<MORTALSVFUNC_SV()> and C<MORTALDESTRUCTOR_SV()> macros, which
make it possible to create a destructor which is fired at the end of
the current statement. This uses the C<PERL_MAGIC_destruct> magic to
use "free" magic to trigger an action when a variable is freed. The
action can be specified as a C function or as a Perl code reference.

=item *

Added the C<%{^HOOK}> api and related C<PERL_MAGIC_hook> and
C<PERL_MAGIC_hookelem> for providing ways to hook selected perl functions
which for one reason or another are problematic to wrap with a customized
subroutine.

=item *

Added support for C<${^HOOK}{require__before}> which can be used to
rewrite the filename that C<require> will try to load, and also to block
C<require> from loading a specific module, even via fully qualified
filename. The hook can also be used to perform "pre-require" and
"post-require" actions.

=item *

Added support for C<${^HOOK}{require__after}> which can be used to
track what modules have been required after the fact.

=item *

Regular expression opcodes (regops) now use a standardized structure
layout that uses unions to expose data in different format. This means
it should be much easier to extend or modify regops to use more memory.
This has been used to make a number of regops track how many parens
they contain.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

In the new experimental C<class> feature, attributes are no longer a syntax
error when using the unit class syntax.
[L<GH #20888|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/20888>].

=item *

A number of bugs related to capture groups in quantified groups in regular
expression have been fixed, especially in alternations. For example in
a pattern like:

	"foobazfoobar" =~ /((foo)baz|foo(bar))+/

the regex variable C<$2> will not be "foo" as it once was, it will be undef.

=item *

Bugs with regex backreference operators that are inside of a capture
group have been fixed. For instance:

    "xa=xaaa" =~ /^(xa|=?\1a){2}\z/

will now correctly not match. [L<GH #10073|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/10073>]

=item *

C<SSGROW()> and C<SSCHECK()> have been reworked to ensure that the requested
space is actually allocated. C<SSCHECK()> is now an alias for C<SSGROW()>.
