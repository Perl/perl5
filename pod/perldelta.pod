=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.37.4

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.37.3 release and the 5.37.4
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.37.2, first read
L<perl5373delta>, which describes differences between 5.37.2 and 5.37.3.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 readline() no longer clears the stream error flag

C<readline()>, also spelled C<< <> >>, would clear the handle's error
flag after an error occurred on the stream.

The error flag is now only cleared when an error occurs when reading
from the child process for glob() in F<miniperl>.  This allows it to
correctly report errors from the child process on close().

Since the error flag is no longer cleared calling close() on the
stream may fail and if the stream was not explicitly closed, the
implicit close of the stream may produce a warning.

[L<GH #20060|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/20060>]

=head2 C<INIT> blocks no longer run after an C<exit()> in C<BEGIN>

C<INIT> blocks will no longer run after an C<exit()> performed inside of
a C<BEGIN>. This means that the combination of the C<-v> option and the
C<-c> option no longer executes a compile check as well as showing the
perl version. The C<-v> option executes an exit(0) after printing the
version information inside of a C<BEGIN> block, and the C<-c> check is
implemented by using C<INIT> hooks, resulting in the C<-v> option taking
precedence.

[L<GH #1537|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/1537>]
[L<GH #20181|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/20181>]

=head2 Syntax errors will no longer produce "phantom error messages".

Generally perl will continue parsing the source code even after
encountering a compile error. In many cases this is helpful, for
instance with misspelled variable names it is helpful to show as many
examples of the error as possible. But in the case of syntax errors
continuing often produces bizarre error messages, and may even cause
segmentation faults during the compile process. In this release the
compiler will halt at the first syntax error encountered. This means
that any code expecting to see the specific error messages we used to
produce will be broken. The error that is emitted will be one of the
diagnostics that used to be produced, but in some cases some messages
that used to be produced will no longer be displayed.

See L<Changes to Existing Diagnostics> for more details.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

L<I18N::Langinfo> has been upgraded from version 0.21 to 0.22.

This module uses the POSIX L<nl_langinfo(3)> function if available, and
emulates it otherwise, such as on Windows.  This new version improves
the handling of the C<CODESET> item.  Now it works completely correctly
on Windows platforms (barring any bugs in Windows functions), and
reliably handles C<UTF-8>, C<C>, and C<POSIX> on other emulated
platforms

=item *

L<XXX> has been upgraded from version A.xx to B.yy.

If there was something important to note about this change, include that here.

The compiler will now stop parsing on the first syntax error it
encounters. Historically the compiler would attempt to "skip past" the
error and continue parsing so that it could list multiple errors. For
things like undeclared variables under strict this makes sense. For
syntax errors however it has been found that continuing tends to result
in a storm of unrelated or bizarre errors that mostly just obscure the
true error. In extreme cases it can even lead to segfaults and other
malbehavior.

Therefore we have reformed the continuation logic so that the parse will
stop after the first seen syntax error. Semantic errors like undeclared
variables will not stop the parse, so you may still see multiple errors
when compiling code. However if there is a syntax error it will be the
last error message reported by perl and all of the errors that you see
will be something that actually needs to be fixed.

=item *

Error messages that output class or package names have been modified to
output double quoted strings with various characters escaped so as to
make the exact value clear to a reader. The exact rules on which
characters are escaped may change over time but currently are that
printable ASCII codepoints, with the exception of C<"> and C<\>, and
unicode word characters whose codepoint is over 255 are output raw, and
any other symbols are escaped much as Data::Dumper might escape them,
using C<\n> for newline and C<\"> for double quotes, etc. Codepoints in
the range 128-255 are always escaped as they can cause trouble on
unicode terminals when output raw.

In older versions of perl the one liner

    $ perl -le'"thing\n"->foo()'

would output the following error message exactly as shown here, with
text spread over multiple lines because the "\n" would be emitted as
a raw newline character:

    Can't locate object method "foo" via package "thing
    " (perhaps you forgot to load "thing
    "?) at -e line 1.

As of this release we would output this instead (as one line):

    Can't locate object method "foo" via package "thing\n"
      (perhaps you forgot to load "thing\n"?) at -e line 1.

Notice the newline in the package name has been quoted and escaped, and
thus the error message is a single line. The text is shown here wrapped
to two lines only for readability.

=item *

When package or class names in errors are very large the middle excess
portion will be elided from the message. As of this release error messages
will show only up to the first 128 characters and the last 128 characters
in a package or class name in error messages. For example

 $ perl -le'("Foo" x 1000)->new()'

will output the following as one line:

 Can't locate object method "new" via package "FooFooFooFooFooFooFoo
 FooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFoo
 FooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFo"..."oFooFooFooFooFooFooFoo
 FooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFoo
 FooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFoo" (perhaps you forgot to load
 "FooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFoo
 FooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFo"...
 "oFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFoo
 FooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFoo"?)
 at -e line 1.

Notice the C< "prefix"..."suffix" > form of the package name in this case.
In previous versions of perl the complete string would have been shown
making the error message over 6k long and there was no upper limit on the
length of the error message at all. If you accidentally used a 1MB string
as a class name then the error message would be over 2MB long. In this perl
the upper limit should be around 2k when eliding and escaping are taken into
account.

=head1 Testing

Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes
in this release.

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

A new API function L<perlapi/C<Perl_localeconv>> is added.  This is the
same as L<C<POSIX::localeconv>|POSIX/localeconv> (returning a hash of
the C<localeconv()>> fields), but directly callable from XS code.

=item *

A new API function L<perlapi/C<my_strftime8>> is added.  This is the
same as plain L<perlapi/C<my_strftime>>, but with an extra parameter
that allows the caller to simply and reliably know if the returned
string is UTF-8.

=item *

A new API function, L<perlapi/C<Perl_langinfo8>> is added.  This is the
same as plain L<perlapi/C<Perl_langinfo>>, but with an extra parameter
that allows the caller to simply and reliably know if the returned
string is UTF-8.

=item *

We have introduced a limit on the number of nested C<eval EXPR>/C<BEGIN>
blocks and C<require>/C<BEGIN> (and thus C<use> statements as well) to
prevent C stack overflows. This variable can also be used to forbid
C<BEGIN> blocks from executing during C<eval EXPR> compilation. The
limit defaults to C<1000> but can be overriden by setting the
C<${^MAX_NESTED_EVAL_BEGIN_BLOCKS}> variable. The default itself can be
changed at compile time with

    -Accflags='-DPERL_MAX_NESTED_EVAL_BEGIN_BLOCKS_DEFAULT=12345'

Note that this value relates to the size of your C stack and if you
choose an inappropriately large value Perl may segfault, be conservative
about what you choose.
