=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.9.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.8.0 release and
the 5.9.0 release.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 The C<$*> variable has been removed

C<$*>, which was deprecated in favor of the C</s> and C</m> regexp
modifiers, has been removed.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Tied Arrays with Negative Array Indices

Formerly, the indices passed to C<FETCH>, C<STORE>, C<EXISTS>, and
C<DELETE> methods in tied array class were always non-negative.  If
the actual argument was negative, Perl would call FETCHSIZE implicitly
and add the result to the index before passing the result to the tied
array method.  This behavior is now optional.  If the tied array class
contains a package variable named C<$NEGATIVE_INDICES> which is set to
a true value, negative values will be passed to C<FETCH>, C<STORE>,
C<EXISTS>, and C<DELETE> unchanged.

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at F<http://bugs.perl.org/>.  There may also be
information at F<http://www.perl.com/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the B<perlbug>
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of C<perl -V>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.
