=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.33.5

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.33.4 release and the 5.33.5
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.33.3, first read
L<perl5334delta>, which describes differences between 5.33.3 and 5.33.4.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 New octal syntax C<0oI<ddddd>>

It is now possible to specify octal literals with C<0o> prefixes,
as in C<0o123_456>, parallel to the existing construct to specify
hexadecimal literal C<0xI<ddddd>> and binary literal C<0bI<ddddd>>.
Also, the builtin C<oct()> function now accepts this new syntax.

See L<perldata/Scalar value constructors> and L<perlfunc/oct EXPR>.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if not applicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=item XXX

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

There may well be none in a stable release.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

=head2 Changes to Existing Documentation

We have attempted to update the documentation to reflect the changes
listed in this document.  If you find any we have missed, open an issue
at L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.

XXX Changes which significantly change existing files in F<pod/> go here.
However, any changes to F<pod/perldiag.pod> should go in the L</Diagnostics>
section.

Additionally, the following selected changes have been made:

=head1 Diagnostics

The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output,
including warnings and fatal error messages.  For the complete list of
diagnostic messages, see L<perldiag>.

XXX New or changed warnings emitted by the core's C<C> code go here.  Also
include any changes in L<perldiag> that reconcile it to the C<C> code.

=head1 Testing

XXX Any significant changes to the testing of a freshly built perl should be
listed here.  Changes which create B<new> files in F<t/> go here as do any
large changes to the testing harness (e.g. when parallel testing was added).
Changes to existing files in F<t/> aren't worth summarizing, although the bugs
that they represent may be covered elsewhere.

XXX If there were no significant test changes, say this:

Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes
in this release.

and compilation changes or changes in portability/compatibility.  However,
changes within modules for platforms should generally be listed in the
L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=item Windows

Windows now supports L<symlink()|perlfunc/symlink> and
L<readlink()|perlfunc/readlink>, and L<lstat()|perlfunc/lstat> is no
longer an alias for L<stat()|perlfunc/stat>.
L<[#18005]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18005>.

Unlike POSIX systems, creating a symbolic link on Windows requires
either elevated privileges or Windows 10 1703 or later with Developer
Mode enabled.

stat(), including C<stat FILEHANDLE>, and lstat() now uses our own
implementation that populates the device C<dev> and inode numbers
C<ino> returned rather than always returning zero.  The number of
links C<nlink> field is now always populated.

L<< C<${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT}> |perlvar/${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT} >> previously
controlled whether the C<nlink> field was populated requiring a
separate Windows API call to fetch, since nlink and the other
information required for stat() is now retrieved in a single API call.

The C<-r> and C<-w> operators now return true for the C<STDIN>,
C<STDOUT> and C<STDERR> handles.  Unfortunately it still won't return
true for duplicates of those handles.
L<[#8502]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/8502>.

The times returned by stat() and lstat() are no longer incorrect
across Daylight Savings Time adjustments.
L<[#6080]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/6080>.

C<-x> on a filehandle should now match C<-x> on the corresponding
filename on Vista or later.
L<[#4145]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/4145>.

C<-e '"'> no longer incorrectly returns true.
L<[#12431]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/12431>.

=head1 Internal Changes

XXX Changes which affect the interface available to C<XS> code go here.  Other
significant internal changes for future core maintainers should be noted as
well.

[ List each change as an =item entry ]

=item *

All C<SvTRUE>-ish functions now evaluate their arguments exactly once.
In 5.32, plain L<perlapi/C<SvTRUE>> was changed to do that; now the rest
do as well.

=back

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

XXX Important bug fixes in the core language are summarized here.  Bug fixes in
files in F<ext/> and F<lib/> are best summarized in L</Modules and Pragmata>.

[ List each fix as an =item entry ]

=over 4

=item *

L<semctl()|perlfunc/semctl>, L<msgctl()|perlfunc/msgctl>, and
L<shmctl()|perlfunc/shmctl> now properly reset the UTF-8 flag on the
C<ARG> parameter if it's modified for C<IPC_STAT> or C<GETALL>
operations.

=item *

semctl(), msgctl(), and shmctl() now attempt to downgrade the C<ARG>
parameter if it's value is being used as input to C<IPC_SET> or
C<SETALL> calls.  A failed downgrade will thrown an exception.

=item *

In cases where semctl(), msgctl() or shmctl() would treat the C<ARG>
parameter as a pointer, an undefined value no longer generates a
warning.  In most such calls the pointer isn't used anyway and this
allows you to supply C<undef> for a value not used by the underlying
function.

=item *

L<semop()|perlfunc/semop> now downgrades the C<OPSTRING> parameter,
L<msgsnd()|perlfunc/msgsnd> now downgrades the C<MSG> parameter and
L<shmwrite|perlfunc/shmwrite> now downgrades the C<STRING> parameter
to treat them as bytes.  Previously they would be left upgraded,
providing a corrupted structure to the underlying function call.

=item *

L<msgrcv()|perlfunc/msgrcv> now properly resets the UTF-8 flag the
C<VAR> parameter when it is modified.  Previusly the UTF-8 flag could
be left on, resulting in a possibly corrupt result in C<VAR>.

=back

=head1 Known Problems

XXX Descriptions of platform agnostic bugs we know we can't fix go here.  Any
tests that had to be C<TODO>ed for the release would be noted here.  Unfixed
platform specific bugs also go here.
