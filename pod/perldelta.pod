=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.19.3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.19.2 release and the 5.19.3
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.19.1, first read
L<perl5192delta>, which describes differences between 5.19.1 and 5.19.2.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 B<-F> now implies B<-a> and B<-a> implies B<-n>

Previously B<-F> without B<-a> was a no-op, and B<-a> without B<-n> or
B<-p> was a no-op, with this change, if you supply B<-F> then both
B<-a> and B<-n> are implied and if you supply B<-a> then B<-n> is implied.

You can still use B<-p> for its extra behaviour. [perl #116190]

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=over

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=back

[ List each other deprecation as a =head2 entry ]

There may well be none in a stable release.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>, which prints stub
entries to STDOUT.  Results can be pasted in place of the '=head2' entries
below.  A paragraph summary for important changes should then be added by hand.
In an ideal world, dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be
cribbed.

=item *

L<B> has been upgraded from version 1.44 to 1.45.

Calling the C<GV> method on C<B::CV> objects created from a lexical

L<Carp> has been upgraded from 1.30 to 1.31

L<Carp> now handles objects with string overloads. It also allows objects
to specify how they appear in the stack dump with a C<CARP_TRACE> method,
and also allows the user to specify their own formatter for objects without
C<CARP_TRACE> as well as other references. [perl #92446]

L<Exporter> has been upgraded from version 5.68 to 5.69.

L<Exporter> would ignore custom C<$SIG{__WARN__}> handlers in
C<Exporter::Heavy>. [perl #39739]

The C<open> tutorial has been completely rewriten by Tom Christiansen, and now

versions of perl.

=item *

Autovivifying a subroutine stub via C<\&$glob> started causing crashes in
Perl 5.18.0 if the $glob was merely a copy of a real glob, i.e., a scalar
that had had a glob assigned to it.  This has been fixed [perl #119051].

=item *

On 64-bit platforms C<pos> can now be set to a value higher than 2**31-1
[perl #72766].

=item *

Perl used to leak an implementation detail when it came to referencing the
return values of certain operators.  C<for ($a+$b) { warn \$_; warn \$_ }>
used to display two different memory addresses, because the C<\> operator
was copying the variable.  Under threaded builds, it would also happen for
constants (C<for(1) { ... }>).  This has been fixed [perl #21979, #78194,
#89188, #109746, #114838, #115388].

=item *

The range operator C<..> was returning the same modifiable scalars with
each call, unless it was the only thing in a C<foreach> loop header.  This
meant that changes to values within the list returned would be visible the
next time the operator was executed [perl #3105].

=item *

Constant folding and subroutine inlining no longer cause operations that
would normally return new modifiable scalars to return read-only values
instead.

=item *

Closures of the form C<sub () { $some_variable }> are no longer inlined,
causing changes to the variable to be ignored by callers of the subroutine
[perl #79908].

=item *

Return values of certain operators such as C<ref> would sometimes be shared
between recursive calls to the same subroutine, causing the inner call to
modify the value returned by C<ref> in the outer call.  This has been
fixed.

=item *

C<__PACKAGE__> and constants returning a package name or hash key are now
consistently read-only.  In various previous Perl releases, they have
become mutable under certain circumstances.

=item *

C</$qr/p> was broken in Perl 5.18.0; the C</p> flag was ignored.  This has
been fixed [perl #118213].

=item *

Starting in v5.18.0, a construct like C</[#](?{})/x> would have its C<#>
incorrectly interpreted as a comment.  The code block would be skipped,
unparsed.  This has been corrected.

=item *

Starting in Perl 5.001, a regular expression like C</[#$a]/x> or
C</[#]$a/x> would have its C<#> incorrectly interpreted as a comment, so
the variable would not interpolate.  This has been corrected [perl #45667].

=item *

On non-threaded builds, setting C<${"_<filename"}> to a reference or
typeglob no longer causes C<__FILE__> in that file to return a corrupt
string.  Threaded builds were unaffected.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
