=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.37.4

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.37.3 release and the 5.37.4
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.37.2, first read
L<perl5373delta>, which describes differences between 5.37.2 and 5.37.3.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 readline() no longer clears the stream error flag

C<readline()>, also spelled C<< <> >>, would clear the handle's error
flag after an error occurred on the stream.

The error flag is now only cleared when an error occurs when reading
from the child process for glob() in F<miniperl>.  This allows it to
correctly report errors from the child process on close().

Since the error flag is no longer cleared calling close() on the
stream may fail and if the stream was not explicitly closed, the
implicit close of the stream may produce a warning.

[github #20060]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if not applicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

L<I18N::Langinfo> has been upgraded from version 0.21 to 0.22.

This module uses the POSIX L<nl_langinfo(3)> function if available, and
emulates it otherwise, such as on Windows.  This new version improves
the handling of the C<CODESET> item.  Now it works completely correctly
on Windows platforms (barring any bugs in Windows functions), and
reliably handles C<UTF-8>, C<C>, and C<POSIX> on other emulated
platforms

=item *

L<XXX> has been upgraded from version A.xx to B.yy.

If there was something important to note about this change, include that here.

=item *

The compiler will now stop parsing on the first syntax error it
encounters. Historically the compiler would attempt to "skip past" the
error and continue parsing so that it could list multiple errors. For
things like undeclared variables under strict this makes sense. For
syntax errors however it has been found that continuing tends to result
in a storm of unrelated or bizarre errors that mostly just obscure the
true error. In extreme cases it can even lead to segfaults and other
malbehavior.

Therefore we have reformed the continuation logic so that the parse will
stop after the first seen syntax error. Semantic errors like undeclared
variables will not stop the parse, so you may still see multiple errors
when compiling code. However if there is a syntax error it will be the
last error message reported by perl and all of the errors that you see
will be something that actually needs to be fixed.

=item *

Error messages that output class or package names have been modified to
output double quoted strings with various characters escaped so as to
make the exact value clear to a reader. The exact rules on which
characters are escaped may change over time but currently are that
printable ASCII codepoints, with the exception of C<"> and C<\>, and
unicode word characters whose codepoint is over 255 are output raw, and
any other symbols are escaped much as Data::Dumper might escape them,
using C<\n> for newline and C<\"> for double quotes, etc. Codepoints in
the range 128-255 are always escaped as they can cause trouble on
unicode terminals when output raw.

In older versions of perl the one liner

    $ perl -le'"thing\n"->foo()'

would output the following error message exactly as shown here, with
text spread over multiple lines because the "\n" would be emitted as
a raw newline character:

    Can't locate object method "foo" via package "thing
    " (perhaps you forgot to load "thing
    "?) at -e line 1.

As of this release we would output this instead (as one line):

    Can't locate object method "foo" via package "thing\n"
      (perhaps you forgot to load "thing\n"?) at -e line 1.

Notice the newline in the package name has been quoted and escaped, and
thus the error message is a single line. The text is shown here wrapped
to two lines only for readability.

=item *

When package or class names in errors are very large the middle excess
portion will be elided from the message. As of this release error messages
will show only up to the first 128 characters and the last 128 characters
in a package or class name in error messages. For example

 $ perl -le'("Foo" x 1000)->new()'

will output the following as one line:

 Can't locate object method "new" via package "FooFooFooFooFooFooFoo
 FooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFoo
 FooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFo"..."oFooFooFooFooFooFooFoo
 FooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFoo
 FooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFoo" (perhaps you forgot to load 
 "FooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFoo
 FooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFo"...
 "oFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFoo
 FooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFoo"?)
 at -e line 1.

Notice the C< "prefix"..."suffix" > form of the package name in this case.
In previous versions of perl the complete string would have been shown
making the error message over 6k long and there was no upper limit on the
length of the error message at all. If you accidentally used a 1MB string
as a class name then the error message would be over 2MB long. In this perl
the upper limit should be around 2k when eliding and escaping are taken into
account.

A new API function L<perlapi/C<Perl_localeconv>> is added.  This is the
same as L<C<POSIX::localeconv>|POSIX/localeconv> (returning a hash of
the C<localeconv()>> fields), but directly callable from XS code.

=item *

A new API function L<perlapi/C<my_strftime8>> is added.  This is the
same as plain L<perlapi/C<my_strftime>>, but with an extra parameter
that allows the caller to simply and reliably know if the returned
string is UTF-8.

=item *

A new API function, L<perlapi/C<Perl_langinfo8>> is added.  This is the
same as plain L<perlapi/C<Perl_langinfo>>, but with an extra parameter
that allows the caller to simply and reliably know if the returned
string is UTF-8.

=item *

We have introduced a limit on the number of nested C<eval EXPR>/C<BEGIN>
blocks and C<require>/C<BEGIN> (and thus C<use> statements as well) to
prevent C stack overflows. This variable can also be used to forbid
C<BEGIN> blocks from executing during C<eval EXPR> compilation. The
limit defaults to C<1000> but can be overriden by setting the
C<${^MAX_NESTED_EVAL_BEGIN_BLOCKS}> variable. The default itself can be
changed at compile time with

    -Accflags='-DPERL_MAX_NESTED_EVAL_BEGIN_BLOCKS_DEFAULT=12345'

Note that this value relates to the size of your C stack and if you
choose an inappropriately large value Perl may segfault, be conservative
about what you choose.
