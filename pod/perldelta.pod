=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.21.6

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.21.5 release and the 5.21.6
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.21.4, first read
L<perl5215delta>, which describes differences between 5.21.4 and 5.21.5.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 List form of pipe open implemented for Win32

The list form of pipe:

  open my $fh, "-|", "program", @arguments;

is now implemented on Win32.  It has the same limitations as C<system
LIST> on Win32, since the Win32 API doesn't accept program arguments
as a list.

=head2 Assignment to list repetition

C<(...) x ...> can now be used within a list that is assigned to, as long
as the left-hand side is a valid lvalue.  This allows C<(undef,undef,$foo)
= that_function()> to be written as C<((undef)x2, $foo) = that_function()>.

=head2 C<close> now sets C<$!>

When an I/O error occurs, the fact that there has been an error is recorded
in the handle.  C<close> returns false for such a handle.  Previously, the
value of C<$!> would be untouched by C<close>, so the common convention of
writing C<close $fh or die $!> did not work reliably.  Now the handle
records the value of C<$!>, too, and C<close> restores it.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=over

=item XXX

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=back

[ List each other deprecation as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Use of non-graphic characters in single-character variable names

The syntax for single-character variable names is more lenient than
for longer variable names, allowing the one-character name to be a
punctuation character or even invisible (a non-graphic).  Perl v5.20
deprecated the ASCII-range controls as such a name.  Now, all
non-graphic characters that formerly were allowed are deprecated.
The practical effect of this occurs only when not under C<S<"use
utf8">>, and affects just the C1 controls (code points 0x80 through
0xFF), NO-BREAK SPACE, and SOFT HYPHEN.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here.
There may well be none in a stable release.

[ List each enhancement as a =item entry ]

=over 4

=item *

C<(...)x1>, C<("constant")x0> and C<($scalar)x0> are now optimised in list
context.  If the right-hand argument is a constant 1, the repetition
operator disappears.  If the right-hand argument is a constant 0, the whole
expressions is optimised to the empty list, so long as the left-hand
argument is a simple scalar or constant.  C<(foo())x0> is not optimised.

=back

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

=over 4

=item *

fchmod() and futimes() now set C<$!> when they fail due to being
passed a closed file handle.  [perl #122703]

=item *

Perl now comes with a corrected Unicode 7.0 for the erratum issued on
October 21, 2014 (see L<http://www.unicode.org/errata/#current_errata>),
dealing with glyph shaping in Arabic.

=item *

op_free() no longer crashes due to a stack overflow when freeing a
deeply recursive op tree. [perl #108276]

=item *

scalarvoid() would crash due to a stack overflow when processing a
deeply recursive op tree. [perl #108276]

=item *

In Perl 5.20.0, C<$^N> accidentally had the internal UTF8 flag turned off
if accessed from a code block within a regular expression, effectively
UTF8-encoding the value.  This has been fixed.  [perl #123135]

=item *

A failed C<semctl> call no longer overwrites existing items on the stack,
causing C<(semctl(-1,0,0,0))[0]> to give an "uninitialized" warning.

=item *

C<else{foo()}> with no space before C<foo> is now better at assigning the
right line number to that statement.  [perl #122695]

=item *

Sometimes the assignment in C<@array = split> gets optimised and C<split>
itself writes directly to the array.  This caused a bug, preventing this
assignment from being used in lvalue context.  So
C<(@a=split//,"foo")=bar()> was an error.  (This bug probably goes back to
Perl 3, when the optimisation was added.)  This optimisation, and the bug,
started to happen in more cases in 5.21.5.  It has now been fixed.
[perl #123057]

=item *

When argument lists that fail the checks installed by subroutine
signatures, the resulting error messages now give the file and line number
of the caller, not of the called subroutine.  [perl #121374]

=item *

Flip-flop operators (C<..> and C<...> in scalar context) used to maintain
a separate state for each recursion level (the number of times the
enclosing sub was called recursively), contrary to the documentation.  Now
each closure has one internal state for each flip-flop.  [perl #122829]

=item *

C<use>, C<no>, statement labels, special blocks (C<BEGIN>) and pod are now
permitted as the first thing in a C<map> or C<grep> block, the block after
C<print> or C<say> (or other functions) returning a handle, and within
C<${...}>, C<@{...}>, etc.  [perl #122782]

=item *

The repetition operator C<x> now propagates lvalue context to its left-hand
argument when used in contexts like C<foreach>.  That allows
C<for(($#that_array)x2) { ... }> to work as expected if the loop modifies
$_.

=back

=head1 Known Problems

XXX Descriptions of platform agnostic bugs we know we can't fix go here.  Any
tests that had to be C<TODO>ed for the release would be noted here.  Unfixed
platform specific bugs also go here.

=item *

Starting in 5.21.6, accessing L<perlapi/CvPADLIST> in an XSUB is forbidden.
CvPADLIST has be reused for a different internal purpose for XSUBs. Guard all
CvPADLIST expressions with C<CvISXSUB()> if your code doesn't already block
XSUB CV*s from going through optree CV* expecting code.

=back

=head1 Errata From Previous Releases

=over 4

=item *

Due to a mistake in the string-copying logic, copying the value of a state
variable could instead steal the value and undefine the variable.  This
bug, introduced in 5.20, would happen mostly for long strings (1250 chars
or more), but could happen for any strings under builds with copy-on-write
disabled.  [perl #123029]

This bug was actually fixed in 5.21.5, but it was not until after that
release that this bug, and the fact that it had been fixed, were
discovered.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
