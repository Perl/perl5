=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.37.7

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.37.6 release and the 5.37.7
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.37.5, first read
L<perl5376delta>, which describes differences between 5.37.5 and 5.37.6.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Defined-or and logical-or assignment default expressions to signatures

The default expression for a subroutine signature parameter can now be
assigned using the C<//=> or C<||=> operators, to apply the defaults whenever
the caller provided an undefined or false value (respectively), rather than
simply when the parameter is missing entirely.  For more detail see the
documentation in L<perlsub>.

=head2 @INC Hook Enhancements and $INC and INCDIR

The internals for C<@INC> hooks have been hardened to handle various
edge cases and should no longer segfault or throw assert failures when
hooks modify C<@INC> during a require operation.  As part of this we
now ensure that any given hook is executed at most once during a require
call, and that any duplicate directories do not trigger additional
directories probes.

To provide developers more control over dynamic module lookup a new hook
method C<INCDIR> is now supported. An object supporting this method may be
injected into the C<@INC> array, and when it is encountered in the module
search process it will be executed, just like how INC hooks are executed,
and its return value used as a list of directories to search for the
module. Returning an empty list acts as a no-op. Note that any references
returned by this hook will be stringified and used as strings, you may not
return a hook to be executed later via this API.

When an C<@INC> hook (either C<INC> or C<INCDIR>) is called during
require the C<$INC> variable will be localized to be the value of the
index of C<@INC> that the hook came from. If the hook wishes to override
what the "next" index in C<@INC> should be it may update C<$INC> to be one
less than the desired index (C<undef> is equivalent to C<-1>). This
allows an C<@INC> hook to completely rewrite the C<@INC> array and have
perl restart its directory probes from the beginning of C<@INC>.

Blessed CODE references in C<@INC> that do not support the C<INC> or
C<INCDIR> methods will no longer trigger an exception, and instead will
be treated the same as unblessed coderefs are, and executed as though
they were an C<INC> hook.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if not applicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

The error message that is produced when a C<require> or C<use> statement
fails has been changed. It used to contain the words C<@INC contains:>,
and it used to show the state of C<@INC> *after* the require had
completed and failed. The error message has been changed to say C<@INC
entries checked:> and to reflect the actual directories or hooks that
were executed during the require statement. For example:

    perl -e'push @INC, sub {@INC=()}; eval "require Frobnitz"
        or die $@'
    Can't locate Frobnitz.pm in @INC (you may need to install the
    Frobnitz module) (@INC contains:) at (eval 1) line 1.

Will change to (with some output elided for clarity):

    perl -e'push @INC, sub {@INC=()}; eval "require Frobnitz"
        or die $@'
    Can't locate Frobnitz.pm in @INC (you may need to install the
    Frobnitz module) (@INC entries checked:
    .../site_perl/5.37.7/x86_64-linux .../site_perl/5.37.7
    .../5.37.7/x86_64-linux .../5.37.7 CODE(0x562745e684b8))
    at (eval 1) line 1.

thus showing the actual directories checked. Code that checks for
C<@INC contains:> in error messages should be hardened against any future
wording changes between the C<@INC> and C<:>, for instance use
C<qr/\@INC[ \w]+:/> instead of using C<qr/\@INC contains:/> or
C<qr/\@INC entries checked:/> in tests as this will ensure both forward
and backward compatibility.

[github #20532]

=item *

L<POSIX::strxfrm|POSIX/strxfrm> now uses the C<LC_CTYPE> locale category
to specify its collation, ignoring any differing C<LC_COLLATE>.  It
doesn't make sense for a string to be encoded in one locale (say,
ISO-8859-6, Arabic) and to collate it based on another (like ISO-8859-7,
Greek).  Perl assumes that the current C<LC_CTYPE> locale correctly
represents the encoding, and collates accordingly.

Also, embedded C<NUL> characters are now allowed in the input.

If locale collation is not enabled on the platform (C<LC_COLLATE>), the
input is returned unchanged.

Double FETCH during stringification of tied scalars returning an
overloaded object have been fixed. The FETCH method should only be
called once, but prior to this release was actually called twice.
