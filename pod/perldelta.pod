=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.17.8

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.17.7 release and the 5.17.8
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.17.6, first read
L<perl5177delta>, which describes differences between 5.17.6 and 5.17.7.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.  In
particular, deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed as
an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

[ List each deprecation as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Various XS-callable functions are now deprecated

All the functions used to classify characters will be removed from a
future version of Perl, and should not be used.  With participating C
compilers (e.g., gcc), compiling any file that uses any of these will
generate a warning.  These were not intended for public use; there are
equivalent, faster, macros for most of them.
See L<perlapi/Character classes>.  The complete list (including some
that were deprecated in 5.17.7) is:
C<is_uni_alnum>, C<is_uni_alnumc>, C<is_uni_alnumc_lc>,
C<is_uni_alnum_lc>, C<is_uni_alpha>, C<is_uni_alpha_lc>,
C<is_uni_ascii>, C<is_uni_ascii_lc>, C<is_uni_blank>,
C<is_uni_blank_lc>, C<is_uni_cntrl>, C<is_uni_cntrl_lc>,
C<is_uni_digit>, C<is_uni_digit_lc>, C<is_uni_graph>,
C<is_uni_graph_lc>, C<is_uni_idfirst>, C<is_uni_idfirst_lc>,
C<is_uni_lower>, C<is_uni_lower_lc>, C<is_uni_print>,
C<is_uni_print_lc>, C<is_uni_punct>, C<is_uni_punct_lc>,
C<is_uni_space>, C<is_uni_space_lc>, C<is_uni_upper>,
C<is_uni_upper_lc>, C<is_uni_xdigit>, C<is_uni_xdigit_lc>,
C<is_utf8_alnum>, C<is_utf8_alnumc>, C<is_utf8_alpha>,
C<is_utf8_ascii>, C<is_utf8_blank>, C<is_utf8_char>,
C<is_utf8_cntrl>, C<is_utf8_digit>, C<is_utf8_graph>,
C<is_utf8_idcont>, C<is_utf8_idfirst>, C<is_utf8_lower>,
C<is_utf8_mark>, C<is_utf8_perl_space>, C<is_utf8_perl_word>,
C<is_utf8_posix_digit>, C<is_utf8_print>, C<is_utf8_punct>,
C<is_utf8_space>, C<is_utf8_upper>, C<is_utf8_xdigit>,
C<is_utf8_xidcont>, C<is_utf8_xidfirst>.

In addition these three functions that have never worked properly are
deprecated:
C<to_uni_lower_lc>, C<to_uni_title_lc>, and C<to_uni_upper_lc>.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>, which prints stub
entries to STDOUT.  Results can be pasted in place of the '=head2' entries
below.  A paragraph summary for important changes should then be added by hand.
In an ideal world, dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be
cribbed.

=item *

A bug in the core typemap caused any C types that map to the T_BOOL core
typemap entry to not be set, updated, or modified when the T_BOOL variable was
used in an OUTPUT: section with an exception for RETVAL. T_BOOL in an INPUT:
section was not affected. Using a T_BOOL return type for an XSUB (RETVAL)
was not affected. A side effect of fixing this bug is, if a T_BOOL is specified
in the OUTPUT: section (which previous did nothing to the SV), and a read only
SV (literal) is passed to the XSUB, croaks like "Modification of a read-only
value attempted" will happen. [perl #115796]

=head1 Known Problems

XXX Descriptions of platform agnostic bugs we know we can't fix go here.  Any
tests that had to be C<TODO>ed for the release would be noted here.  Unfixed

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
