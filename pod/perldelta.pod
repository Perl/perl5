=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.36.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.sXXX.bXXX release and the 5.tXXX.cXXX
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.rXXX.aXXX, first read
L<perl5XXXdelta>, which describes differences between 5.rXXX.aXXX and 5.sXXX.bXXX.

=head1 Notice

With this release, the experimental C<switch> feature, present in every feature
bundle since they were introduced in v5.10, has been removed from the v5.36
bundle.  If you want to live dangerously and use it, you'll have to enable it
explicitly.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 C<use v5.36> enables warnings

All warnings are enabled automatically within the scope of
a C<L<use v5.35|perlfunc/use VERSION>> (or higher) declaration.

=head2 C<use v5.36> now disables bareword_filehandles, indirect, and multidimensional

The C<:5.36> bundle, loaded by C<use v5.36>, no longer includes
C<bareword_filehandles>, C<indirect>, or C<multidimensional> meaning that these
discouraged forms of syntax will not be allowed within the scope of that
version declaration.

=head2 C<defer> blocks

This release adds support for C<defer> blocks, which are blocks of code
prefixed by the C<defer> modifier. They provide a section of code which runs
at a later time, during scope exit.

For more information, see L<perlsyn/"defer blocks">.

=head2 Unicode 14.0 is supported

See L<https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/> for details.

=head2 SIGFPE no longer deferred

Floating-point exceptions are now delivered immediately, in the same way
as other "fault"-like signals such as SIGSEGV. This means one has at
least a chance to catch such a signal with a C<$SIG{FPE}> handler, e.g.
so that C<die> can report the line in perl that triggered it.

=head2 Stable boolean tracking

The "true" and "false" boolean values, often accessed by constructions like
C<!!0> and C<!!1>, as well as being returned from many core functions and
operators, now remember their boolean nature even through assignment into
variables. The new function C<isbool()> in L<Scalar::Util> can check whether
a value has boolean nature.

This is likely to be useful when interoperating with other languages or
data-type serialisation, among other places.

=head2 iterating over multiple values at a time

As of Perl 5.36, you can iterate over multiple values at a time by specifying
a list of lexicals within parentheses. For example,

    for my ($key, $value) (%hash) { ... }
    for my ($left, $right, $gripping) (@moties) { ... }

Attempting to specify a list after C<for my> was previously a syntax error.

For more detail see L<perlsyn/Compound Statements>.

=head2 builtin Functions

A new core module L<builtin> has been added, which provides documentation for
new always-present functions that are built into the interpreter.

    say "Reference type of arrays is ", builtin::reftype([]);

It also provides a lexical import mechanism for providing short name versions
of these functions.

    use builtin 'reftype';
    say "Reference type of arrays is ", reftype([]);

An initial set of functions exists to provide convenient access to stable
boolean values, weakening references, and inspecting properties of references.

This builtin function mechanism and the functions it provides are all
currently B<experimental>.

For more information, see the L<builtin> module.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if not applicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=item *

We now probe for compiler support for C11 thread local storage, and where
available use this for "implicit context" for XS extensions making API calls for
a threaded Perl build.  This requires fewer function calls at the C level than
POSIX thread specific storage. We continue to use the the pthreads approach if
the C11 approach is not available.

F<Configure> run with the defaults will build an unthreaded Perl (which is
slightly faster), but most operating systems ship a threaded Perl.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

the risk that your code may break in a future Perl version.

The Perl C source code now uses some C99 features, which we have verified are
supported by all compilers we target. This means that Perl's headers now
contain some code that is legal in C99 but not C89.

This may cause problems for some XS modules that unconditionally add
C<-Werror=declaration-after-statement> to their C compiler flags if compiling
with gcc or clang. Earlier versions of Perl support long obsolete compilers
that are strict in rejecting certain C99 features, particularly mixed
declarations and code, and hence it makes sense for XS module authors to audit
that their code does not violate this. However, doing this is now only
possible on these earlier versions of Perl, hence these modules need to be
changed to only add this flag for C<<$] < 5.035005>>.

=item *

The makedepend step is now run in parallel by using make

This reduces the time for

  time sh ./makedepend MAKE=make cflags

from 5 seconds to 2 seconds with MAKEFLAGS=-j8

=item *

F<Configure> now tests whether C<< #include <xlocale.h> >> is required
to use the POSIX 1003 thread-safe locale functions or some related
extensions.  This prevents problems where a non-public F<xlocale.h> is
removed in a library update, or F<xlocale.h> isn't intended for public
use. (github L<#18936|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/18936>)

Support for old MSVC++ (pre-VC12) has been removed

These did not support C99 and hence can no longer be used to compile perl.

The :win32 IO layer has been removed. This experimental replacement for the
:unix layer never reached maturity in its nearly two decades of existence.

=back

=head2 VMS

=over 4

=item C<keys %ENV> on VMS returns consistent results

On VMS entries in the C<%ENV> hash are loaded from the OS environment on
first access, hence the first iteration of C<%ENV> requires the entire
environment to be scanned to find all possible keys. This initialisation had
always been done correctly for full iteration, but previously was not
happening for C<%ENV> in scalar context, meaning that C<scalar %ENV> would
return 0 if called before any other C<%ENV> access, or would only return the
count of keys accessed if there had been no iteration.

These bugs are now fixed - C<%ENV> and C<keys %ENV> in scalar context now
return the correct result - the count of all keys in the environment.

=head2 New Platforms

DJGPP is a port of the GNU toolchain to 32-bit x86 systems running
DOS.  The last known attempt to build Perl on it was on 5.20, which
only got as far as building miniperl.

=item NetWare

Support code for Novell NetWare has been removed.  NetWare was a
server operating system by Novell.  The port was last updated in July
2002, and the platform itself in May 2009.

Since the removal of PERL_OBJECT in Perl 5.8, PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT and
MULTIPLICITY have been synonymous and they were being used interchangeably.
To simplify the code, all instances of PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT have been
replaced with MULTIPLICITY.

PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT will remain defined for compatibility with XS modules.

=item *

The API constant formerly named C<G_ARRAY>, indicating list context, has now
been renamed to a more accurate C<G_LIST>.  A compatibilty macro C<G_ARRAY> has
been added to allow existing code to work unaffected.  New code should be
written using the new constant instead.  This is supported by C<Devel::PPPort>
version 3.63.

Macros have been added to F<perl.h> to facilitate version comparisons:
C<PERL_GCC_VERSION_GE>, C<PERL_GCC_VERSION_GT>, C<PERL_GCC_VERSION_LE> and

=item *

utime() now correctly sets errno/C<$!> when called on a closed handle.

=item *

The flags on the OPTVAL parameter to setsockopt() were previously
checked before magic was called, possibly treating a numeric value as
a packed buffer or vice versa.  It also ignored the UTF-8 flag,
potentially treating the internal representation of an upgraded SV as
the bytes to supply to the setsockopt() system call.  (github L<#18660|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18660>)

Only set IOKp, not IOK on $) and $(.
This was issue L<#18955|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18955>: This will prevent serializers from serializing these
variables as numbers (which loses the additional groups).
This restores behaviour from 5.16

=item *

Use of the C<mktables> debugging facility would cause perl to croak since
v5.31.10; this problem has now been fixed.

C<makedepend> logic is now compatible with BSD make (fixes
L<GH #19046|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19046>).

=item *

Calling C<untie> on a tied hash that is partway through iteration now frees the
iteration state immediately.

Iterating a tied hash causes perl to store a copy of the current hash key to
track the iteration state, with this stored copy passed as the second parameter
to C<NEXTKEY>. This internal state is freed immediately when tie hash iteration
completes, or if the hash is destroyed, but due to an implementation oversight,
it was not freed if the hash was untied. In that case, the internal copy of the
key would persist until the earliest of

=over 4

=item 1

C<tie> was called again on the same hash

=item 2

The (now untied) hash was iterated (ie passed to any of C<keys>, C<values> or
C<each>)

=item 3

The hash was destroyed.

=back

This inconsistency is now fixed - the internal state is now freed immediately by
C<untie>.

As the precise timing of this behaviour can be observed with pure Perl code
(the timing of C<DESTROY> on objects returned from C<FIRSTKEY> and C<NEXTKEY>)
it's just possible that some code is sensitive to it.

The C<Internals::getcwd()> function added for bootstrapping miniperl
in perl 5.30.0 is now only available in miniperl. [github #19122]

Setting a breakpoint on a BEGIN or equivalently a C<use> statement
