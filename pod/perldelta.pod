=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.19.9

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.19.8 release and the 5.19.9
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.19.7, first read
L<perl5198delta>, which describes differences between 5.19.7 and 5.19.8.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

=head2 UTF-8 locales now supported better under C<S<use locale>>

A UTF-8 locale is one in which the character set is Unicode and the
encoding is UTF-8.  Now, the POSIX C<LC_CTYPE> category operations under
such a locale (within the scope of C<S<use locale>>), which include case
changing (like C<lc()>, C<"\U">), and character classification (C<\w>,
C<\D>, C<qr/[[:punct:]]/> work just as if not under locale, except taint
rules are followed.  Prior to this, Perl only handled single-byte
locales.  This resolves [perl #56820].

=head2 C<S<use locale>> now compiles on systems without locale ability

Previously doing this caused the program to not compile.  Within its
scope the program behaves as if in the "C" locale.  Thus programs
written for platforms that support locales can run on locale-less
platforms without change.  Attempts to change the locale away from the
"C" locale will, of course, fail.

=head2 PERL_DEBUG_READONLY_COW

On some operating systems Perl can be compiled in such a way that any
attempt to modify string buffers shared by multiple SVs will crash.  This
way XS authors can test that their modules handle copy-on-write scalars
correctly.  See L<perlguts/"Copy on Write"> for detail.

This feature was actually added in 5.19.8, but was unintentionally omitted
from its delta document.

=head2 C<-DL> runtime option now added for tracing locale setting

This is designed for Perl core developers to aid in field debugging bugs
regarding locales.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 Tainting happens under more circumstances; now conforms to documentation

When changing the case of a string (C<lc>, C<"\U">, I<etc>.), within the
scope of C<use locale>, the result is now tainted no matter what the
contents of the string were, as the documentation (L<perlsec>,
L<perllocale/SECURITY>) indicates it should.   Previously, if the string
contained no characters whose case change could be affected by the
locale, the result would not be tainted.  For example, the result of
C<uc()> on an empty string or one containing only above-Latin1 code
points is now tainted.  This leads to more consistent tainting results.

=head1 Deprecations

=over 4

=item *

Setting C<$/> to a reference to zero or a reference to a negative integer is
now deprecated, and will behave B<exactly> as though it was set to C<undef>.
If you want slurp behavior set C<$/> to C<undef> explicitly.

=item *

Setting C<$/> to a reference to a non integer is now forbidden and will
throw an error. Perl has never documented what would happen in this
context and while it used to behave the same as setting C<$/> to
the address of the references in future it may behave differently, so we
have forbidden this usage.

=back

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here.
There may well be none in a stable release.

[ List each enhancement as a =item entry ]

=over 4

=item *

Code like:

  my $x; # or @x, %x
  my $y;

is now optimized to:

  my ($x, $y);

In combination with the padrange optimization, this means longer
uninitialized my variable statements are also optimized, so:

  my $x; my @y; my %z;

becomes:

  my ($x, @y, %z);

=item *

The cross-compilation model has been renovated.
There's several new options, and some backwards-incompatible changes:

We now build binaries for miniperl and generate_uudmap to be used on the host, rather than running
every miniperl call on the target; this means that, short of 'make test',
we no longer need access to the target system once Configure is done.
You can provide already-built binaries through the C<hostperl> and
C<hostgenerate> options to Configure.

Additionally, if targeting an EBCDIC platform from an ASCII host,
or viceversa, you'll need to run Configure with C<-Uhostgenerate>, to
indicate that generate_uudmap should be run on the target.

Finally, there's also a way of having Configure end early, right after
building the host binaries, by cross-compiling without specifying a
C<targethost>.

The incompatible changes include no longer using xconfig.h, xlib, or
Cross.pm, so canned config files and Makefiles will have to be updated.

=item *

Related to the above, there is now a way of specifying the location of sh
(or equivalent) on the target system: C<targetsh>.

For example, Android has its sh in /system/bin/sh, so if cross-compiling
from a more normal Unixy system with sh in /bin/sh, "targetsh" would end
up as /system/bin/sh, and "sh" as /bin/sh.

=item Regexp Engine Changes That Affect The Pluggable Regex Engine Interface

Many flags that used to be exposed via regexp.h and used to populate the
extflags member of struct regexp have been removed. These fields were
technically private to Perl's own regexp engine and should not have been
exposed there in the first place.

The affected flags are:

    RXf_NOSCAN
    RXf_CANY_SEEN
    RXf_GPOS_SEEN
    RXf_GPOS_FLOAT
    RXf_ANCH_BOL
    RXf_ANCH_MBOL
    RXf_ANCH_SBOL
    RXf_ANCH_GPOS

As well as the follow flag masks:

    RXf_ANCH_SINGLE
    RXf_ANCH

All have been renamed to PREGf_ equivalents and moved to regcomp.h.

The behavior previously achieved by setting one or more of the RXf_ANCH_
flags (via the RXf_ANCH mask) have now been replaced by a *single* flag bit
in extflags:

    RXf_IS_ANCHORED

pluggable regex engines which previously used to set these flags should
now set this flag ALONE.

Backticks (C< `` > or C< qx// >) combined with multiple threads on

=item perl5180delta.pod

This pod file contains a statement saying that C<RXf_SPLIT> (and its alias
C<RXf_PMf_SPLIT>) and C<RXf_SKIPWHITE> were no longer used and #defined
to 0. This was the case for a short period, but the change was reverted
before Perl 5.18 was released. As such it was not true in Perl 5.18.x,
and is also not true now. Both flags continue to be used. The incorrect
entry has been removed from C<perl5180delta.pod> in this release.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
