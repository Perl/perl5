This deprecation was scheduled to become fatal in 5.30, but has been

=over 4

=item *

=item *

Thoroughly test paragraph mode, using a new test file,
F<t/io/paragraph_mode.t>. L<[perl #133722]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133722>.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

Fixed a failure to match properly.

An EXACTFish regnode has a finite length it can hold for the string
being matched.  If that length is exceeded, a second node is used for
the next segment of the string, for as many regnodes as are needed.
Care has to be taken where to break the string, in order to deal
multi-character folds in Unicode correctly. If we want to break a
string at a place which could potentially be in the middle of a
multi-character fold, we back off one (or more) characters, leaving
a shorter EXACTFish regnode. This backing off mechanism contained
an off-by-one error. L<[perl #133756]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133756>.

=item *

A bare C<eof> call with no previous file handle now returns true.
L<[perl #133721]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133721>

=item *

Failing to compile a format now aborts compilation.  Like other errors
in sub-parses this could leave the parser in a strange state, possibly
crashing perl if compilation continued.  L<[perl #132158]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132158>

=head1 Acknowledgements

Perl 5.29.7 represents approximately 5 weeks of development since Perl
5.29.6 and contains approximately 97,000 lines of changes across 350 files
from 8 authors.

Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were
approximately 27,000 lines of changes to 190 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant
community of users and developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.29.7:

Abigail, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Eugen Konkov, Hauke D, James E Keenan,
Karl Williamson, Tomasz Konojacki, Tony Cook.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please
see the F<AUTHORS> file in the Perl source distribution.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/>.  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the C<perlthanks> program:

    perlthanks

This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
