=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.39.10

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.39.9 release and the 5.39.10
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.39.8, first read
L<perl5399delta>, which describes differences between 5.39.8 and 5.39.9.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 The C<:5.40> feature bundle adds C<try> and C<extra_paired_delimiters>

The latest version feature bundle now contains the recently-stablised features
C<try> and C<extra_paired_delimiters>. As this feature bundle is used by the
C<-E> commandline switch, these are immediately available in C<-E> scripts.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if not applicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<deprecated>-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=item XXX

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here.
There may well be none in a stable release.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If L<Module::CoreList> is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

[ Within each section, list entries as an =item entry ]

=head2 Changes to Existing Documentation

We have attempted to update the documentation to reflect the changes
listed in this document.  If you find any we have missed, open an issue
at L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.

XXX Changes which significantly change existing files in F<pod/> go here.
However, any changes to F<pod/perldiag.pod> should go in the L</Diagnostics>
section.

Additionally, the following selected changes have been made:

=head3 L<perlhacktips>

=over 4

=item *

Added brief documentation for some tools useful when developing perl
itself on Windows or Cygwin.

=back

=head3 L<perlapi/form>

=over 4

=item *

Corrected the documentation for C<Perl_form>, C<form_nocontext>, and
C<vform>, which claimed that any later call to one of them will destroy
the previous returns from any.  This hasn't been true since 5.6.0,
except it does remain true if these are called during global
destruction.  With that caveat, the return of each of these is a fresh
string in a temporary that will automatically be freed by a call to
L<perlapi/C<FREETMPS>> or at at places such as statement boundaries.

=back

=head1 Diagnostics

The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output,
including warnings and fatal error messages.  For the complete list of
diagnostic messages, see L<perldiag>.

XXX New or changed warnings emitted by the core's C<C> code go here.  Also
include any changes in L<perldiag> that reconcile it to the C<C> code.

L<Cannot create an object of incomplete class "%s"|perldiag/"Cannot create an object of incomplete class "%s"">

(F) An attempt was made to create an object of a class where the start
of the class definition has been seen, but the class has not been
completed.

This can happen for a failed eval, or if you attempt to create an
object at compile time before the class is complete:

  eval "class Foo {"; Foo->new; # error
  class Bar { BEGIN { Bar->new } }; # error

Previously perl would assert or crash. [github #22159]

=head1 Configuration and Compilation

L</Platform Support> section, instead.

You can now separately enable high water mark checks for non-DEBUGGING
or disable them for DEBUGGING builds with C<-Accflags=-DPERL_USE_HWM>

same.  [github #16607]

=head1 Testing

XXX Any significant changes to the testing of a freshly built perl should be
listed here.  Changes which create B<new> files in F<t/> go here as do any
large changes to the testing harness (e.g. when parallel testing was added).
Changes to existing files in F<t/> aren't worth summarizing, although the bugs
that they represent may be covered elsewhere.

XXX If there were no significant test changes, say this:

Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes

prepare_export_lexical() was separately saving C<PL_comppad> and

fork() failures on cygwin with C<-DDEBUGGING> builds.

Perl uses the C<--enable-auto-image-base> option to set the base
images for DLLs for C<cygperl5_39_10.dll> and the DLLs needed for
dynamically loaded modules on cygwin.

With 5.39.10 if perl is built with C<-DDEBUGGING> or possibly other
options that increase the address space used by F<cygperl5_39_10.dll>,
the address space for F<cygperl5_39_10.dll> overlaps with the address
space allocated for F<mro.dll>.

The C<mro> module will still load, but if perl attempts to fork you
will likely see an error like:

 0 [main] perl 34054 child_info_fork::abort: address space needed by \
    'mro.dll' (0x400000) is already occupied

You can workaround this by building without the C<-DDEBUGGING> option,
or by making C<mro> a static extension:

  ./Configure ... -Astatic_ext=mro

We expect the name change of the F<cygperl5_39_10.dll> to
F<cygperl5_39_11.dll> in 5.39.11 will fix this problem for the next
release.  [github #22104]
