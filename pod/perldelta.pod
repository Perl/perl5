=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file. Any text flagged as
XXX needs to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.15.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.15.1 release and
the 5.15.0 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.14.0, first read
L<perl5150delta>, which describes differences between 5.14.0 and
5.15.0.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here. Summarise user-visible core language
enhancements. Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 C<splice()> doesn't warn when truncating

You can now limit the size of an array using C<splice(@a,MAX_LEN)> without
worrying about warnings.

=head2 The C<\$> prototype accepts any scalar lvalue

The C<\$> and C<\[$]> subroutine prototypes now accept any scalar lvalue
argument.  Previously they only accepted scalars beginning with C<$> and
hash and array elements.  This change makes them consistent with the way
the built-in C<read> and C<recv> functions (among others) parse their
arguments. This means that one can override the built-in functions with
custom subroutines that parse their arguments the same way.

=head2 You can now C<study> more than one string

The restriction that you can only have one C<study> active at a time has been
removed. You can now usefully C<study> as many strings as you want (until you
exhaust memory).

=head2 The Unicode C<Script_Extensions> property is now supported.

New in Unicode 6.0, this is an improved C<Script> property.  Details
are in L<perlunicode/Scripts>.

=head2 DTrace probes for interpreter phase change

The C<phase-change> probes will fire when the interpreter's phase
changes, which tracks the C<${^GLOBAL_PHASE}> variable. C<arg0> is
the new phase name; C<arg1> is the old one. This is useful mostly
for limiting your instrumentation to one or more of: compile time,
run time, destruct time.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.
In particular, deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are
listed as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

[ List each deprecation as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here. There
may well be none in a stable release.

[ List each enhancement as a =item entry ]

=item *

The implementation of C<s///r> makes one less copy of the scalar's value.

=item *

If a studied scalar is C<split> with a regex, the engine will now take
advantage of the C<study> data.

=item *

C<study> now uses considerably less memory for shorter strings. Strings shorter
than 65535 characters use roughly half the memory than previously, strings
shorter than 255 characters use roughly one quarter of the memory.

=item *

Recursive calls to lvalue subroutines in lvalue scalar context use less
memory.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>, which prints stub
entries to STDOUT.  Results can be pasted in place of the '=head2' entries
below.  A paragraph summary for important changes should then be added by hand.
In an ideal world, dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be
cribbed.

L<CGI> has been upgraded from version 3.54 to version 3.55

[THINGS THAT MAY BREAK YOUR CODE]

C<url()> was fixed to return C<PATH_INFO> when it is explicitly requested
with either the path=>1 or path_info=>1 flag.

If your code is running under mod_rewrite (or compatible) and you are calling C<self_url()> or
you are calling C<url()> and passing path_info=>1, These methods will actually be
returning C<PATH_INFO> now, as you have explicitly requested, or has C<self_url()>
has requested on your behalf.

The C<PATH_INFO> has been omitted in such URLs since the issue was introduced
in the 3.12 release in December, 2005.

This bug is so old your application may have come to depend on it or
workaround it. Check for application before upgrading to this release.

Examples of affected method calls:

  $q->url(-absolute => 1, -query => 1, -path_info => 1 )
  $q->url(-path=>1)
  $q->url(-full=>1,-path=>1)
  $q->url(-rewrite=>1,-path=>1)
  $q->self_url();

Perl 4-era .pl libraries

Perl used to bundle a handful of library files that predate Perl 5. Most of
these files, which have been deprecated since version 5.14.0, have now been
removed. If your code still relies on these libraries, you can install them
again from C<Perl4::CoreLibs> on CPAN.

Applying the :lvalue attribute to subroutine that is already defined does
not work properly, as the attribute changes the way the sub is compiled.
Hence, Perl 5.12 began warning when an attempt is made to apply the
attribute to an already defined sub.  In such cases, the attribute is
discarded.

But the change in 5.12 missed the case where custom attributes are also
present: that case still silently and ineffectively applied the attribute.
That omission has now been corrected.  C<sub foo :lvalue :Whatever> (when
C<foo> is already defined) now warns about the :lvalue attribute, and does
not apply it.

L<attributes.pm|attributes> has likewise been updated to warn and not apply
the attribute.

=item *

=for comment
Not necessary for perl5160delta

The remaining discrepancies between explicit and implicit return from
lvalue subroutines have been resolved.  They mainly involved which error
message to display when a read-only value is returned in lvalue context.
Also, returning a PADTMP (the result of most built-ins, like C<index>) in
lvalue context is now forbidden for explicit return, as it always has been
for implicit return.  This is not a regression from 5.14, as all the cases
in which it could happen where previously syntax errors.

=item *

=for comment
Not necessary for perl5160delta

Explicitly returning a tied C<my> variable from an lvalue subroutine in
list lvalue context used to clear the variable before the assignment could
happen.  This is something that was missed when explicit return was made to
work in 5.15.0.

=item *

=for comment
Not necessary for perl5160delta

A minor memory leak, introduced in 5.15.0, has been fixed.  It would occur
when a hash is freed that has had its current iterator deleted
[perl #93454].

=item *

The C<prototype> function now returns a prototype (the empty string) for
the C<__FILE__>, C<__LINE__> and C<__PACKAGE__> directives, instead of
dying, as they are indistinguishable syntactically from nullary functions
like C<time>.

=item *

A bug affecting lvalue context propagation through nested lvalue subroutine
calls has been fixed.  Previously, returning a value in nested rvalue
context would be treated as lvalue context by the inner subroutine call,
resulting in some values (such as read-only values) being rejected.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug>
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of C<perl -V>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes
all the core committers, who will be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently
distributed on CPAN.
