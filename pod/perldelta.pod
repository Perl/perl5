=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.29.4

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.29.3 release and the 5.29.4
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.29.2, first read
L<perl5293delta>, which describes differences between 5.29.2 and 5.29.3.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 The maximum number of times a pattern can match has been doubled
to 65535

This means if you specify C<qr/a+/> that there can be anywhere from 1
through 65535 C<"a">'s in a row, instead of 32267 as previously.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 Assigning non-zero to C<$[> is fatal

Setting L<< C<$[>|perlvar/$[ >> to a non-zero value has been deprecated since
Perl 5.12 and now throws a fatal error.
See L<<< perldeprecation/Assigning non-zero to C<< $[ >> is fatal >>>.

=head2 Previously deprecated sysread()/syswrite() on :utf8 handles now fatal

Calling sysread(), syswrite(), send() or recv() on a C<:utf8> handle,
whether applied explicitly or implicitly, is now fatal.  This was
deprecated in perl 5.24.

There were two problems with calling these functions on C<:utf8>
handles:

=over

=item *

All four functions only paid attention to the C<:utf8> flag.  Other
layers were completely ignored, so a handle with
C<:encoding(UTF-16LE)> layer would be treated as UTF-8.  Other layers,
such as compression are completely ignored with or without the
C<:utf8> flag.

=item *

sysread() and recv() would read from the handle, skipping any
validation by the layers, and do no validation of their own.  This
could lead to invalidly encoded perl scalars.

[perl #125760]

=head2 my() in false conditional prohibited

Declarations such as C<my $x if 0> are no longer permitted.

[perl #133543]

=head2 Fatalize $* and $#

These special variables, long deprecated, now throw exceptions when used.

[perl #133583]

=head2 Fatalize unqualified use of dump()

The C<dump()> function, long discouraged, may no longer be used unless it is
fully qualified, I<i.e.>, C<CORE::dump()>.

[perl #133584]

=head2 Remove File::Glob::glob()

The C<File::Glob::glob()> function, long deprecated, has been removed and now
throws an exception which advises use of C<File::Glob::bsd_glob()> instead.

[perl #133586]

C<pack "u", "invalid uuencoding"> now properly NUL terminates the
zero-length SV produced.  [perl #132655]

=item *

Improve the debugging output for calloc() calls with C<-Dm>.  [perl #133439]

=item *

Regexp script runs were failing to permit ASCII digits in some cases.
[perl #133547]

=item *

On Unix-like systems supporting a platform-specific technique for
determining L<< C<$^X>|perlvar/$^X >>, Perl failed to fall back to the
generic technique when the platform-specific one fails (for example, a Linux
system with /proc not mounted).  This was a regression in Perl 5.28.0.

=head1 Acknowledgements

Perl 5.29.4 represents approximately 4 weeks of development since Perl
5.29.3 and contains approximately 8,400 lines of changes across 180 files
from 17 authors.

Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were
approximately 6,300 lines of changes to 110 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant
community of users and developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.29.4:

Aaron Crane, Alexandr Savca, Andreas König, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Craig
A. Berry, Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker, David Mitchell, Eugen Konkov, James E
Keenan, John SJ Anderson, Karl Williamson, Matthias Bethke, Nicolas R.,
Sisyphus, Slaven Rezic, Tomasz Konojacki, Tony Cook.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

see the F<AUTHORS> file in the Perl source distribution.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the C<perlthanks> program:

    perlthanks

This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
