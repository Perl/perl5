=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.33.6

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.33.5 release and the
5.33.6 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.33.4, first read
L<perl5335delta>, which describes differences between 5.33.4 and 5.33.5.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 C<qr/{,n}/> is now accepted

An empty lower bound is now accepted for regular expression quantifiers,
like C<{,3}>.

=head2 Blanks freely allowed within but adjacent to curly braces

(in double-quotish contexts and regular expression patterns)

This means you can write things like S<C<\x{ FFFC }>> if you like.  This
applies to all such constructs, namely C<\b{}>, C<\g{}>, C<\k{}>,
C<\N{}>, C<\o{}>, and C<\x{}>; as well as the regular expression
quantifier C<{I<m>,I<n>}>.  C<\p{}> and C<\P{}> retain their
already-existing, even looser, rules mandated by the Unicode standard
(see L<perluniprops/Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}>).

This ability is in effect regardless of the presence of the C</x>
regular expression pattern modifier.

Additionally, the comma in a regular expression braced quantifier may
have blanks (tabs or spaces) before and/or after the comma, like
S<C<qr/a{ 5, 7 }/>>.

adapted.

=head2 Platform-Specific Notes

=over 4

=item Mac OS X

A number of system libraries no longer exist as actual files on Big Sur,
even though C<dlopen> will pretend they do, so now we fall back to C<dlopen>
if a library file can not be found.
[L<GH #18407|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18407>]

=item MS Windows

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

Skip trying to constant fold an incomplete op tree
[L<GH #18380|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18380>]

Constant folding of chained comparison op trees could fail under certain
conditions, causing perl to crash. As a quick fix, constant folding is
now skipped for such op trees. This also addresses
[L<GH #17917|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17917>].

=item *

%g formatting broken on Ubuntu-18.04, NVSIZE == 8
[L<GH #18170|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18170>]

Buggy libc implementations of the C<gcvt> and C<qgcvt> functions
caused C<(s)printf> to incorrectly truncate C<%g> formatted numbers.
A new Configure probe now checks for this, with the result that the libc
C<sprintf> will be used in place of C<gcvt> and C<qgcvt>.

Tests added as part of this fix also revealed related problems in
some Windows builds. The makefiles for MINGW builds on Windows have
thus been adjusted to use USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO by default, ensuring
that they also provide correct C<(s)printf> formatting of numbers.

=item *

op.c: croak on "my $_" when "use utf8" is in effect
[L<GH #18449|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18449>]

The lexical topic feature experiment was removed in Perl v5.24 and
declaring C<my $_> became a compile time error. However, it was previously
still possible to make this declaration if C<use utf8> was in effect.

=item *

regexec.c: Fix assertion failure
[L<GH #18451|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18451>]

Fuzzing triggered an assertion failure in the regexp engine when too many
characters were copied into a buffer.
