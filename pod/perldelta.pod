=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.19.11

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.19.10 release and the 5.19.11
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.19.9, first read
L<perl51910delta>, which describes differences between 5.19.9 and 5.19.10.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=item Win32

The time taken to build perl on Windows has been reduced quite significantly
(time savings in the region of 30-40% are typically seen) by reducing the
number of, usually failing, I/O calls for each L<perlfunc/require> (for
miniperl only).
[L<perl #121119|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=121119>]

About 15 minutes of idle sleeping was removed from running C<make test> due to
a bug in which the timeout monitor used for tests could not be cancelled once
the test completes, and the full timeout period elapsed before running the next
test file.
[L<perl #121395|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=121395>]

On a perl built without psuedo-fork (psuedo-fork builds were not affected by
this bug), killing a process tree with L<perlfunc/kill> and a negative signal
resulted in kill() inverting the returned value.  For example, if kill() killed
1 process tree PID then it returned 0 instead of 1, and if kill() was passed 2
invalid PIDs then it returned 2 instead of 0.  This has probably been the case
since the process tree kill feature was implemented on Win32.  It has now been
corrected to follow the documented behaviour.
[L<perl #121230|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=121230>]

The test harness now has no failures when perl is built on a FAT drive with the
Windows OS on an NTFS drive.

well.

[ List each change as a =item entry ]

=item *

C<LC_NUMERIC> is now initialized to the C locale.  This affects only
C<XS> modules, as the Perl core usages always make sure this locale
category is correctly set for their purposes.  C<XS> code remains
vulnerable to other code changing this category's locale.  Further fixes
are planned in v5.22 to reduce these long-standing vulnerabilities.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
