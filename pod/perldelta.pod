=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.39.7

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.39.6 release and the 5.39.7
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.39.5, first read
L<perl5396delta>, which describes differences between 5.39.5 and 5.39.6.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

=head2 Changes to Existing Documentation

We have attempted to update the documentation to reflect the changes
listed in this document.  If you find any we have missed, open an issue
at L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

C<dAX>, C<dITEMS> and hence C<dXSARGS> now declare C<AX> and C<items>
as C<Stack_off_t> rather than C<SSize_t>.  This reverts back to
compatibility with pre-64-bit stack support for default builds of perl
where C<Stack_off_t> is C<I32>.  [GH #21782]

=item *

A new function is now available to C<XS> code, L<perlapi/sv_langinfo>.
This provides the same information as the existing
L<perlapi/Perl_langinfo8>, but returns an SV instead of a S<C<char *>>,
so that programmers don't have to concern themselves with the UTF-8ness
of the result.  This new function is now the preferred interface for
C<XS> code to the L<nl_langinfo(3)> C<libc> function.  From Perl space,
this information continues to be provided by the L<I18N::Langinfo>
module.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the C<perlthanks> program:
