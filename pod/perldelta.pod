=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.31.9

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.31.8 release and the 5.31.9
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.31.7, first read
L<perl5318delta>, which describes differences between 5.31.7 and 5.31.8.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Unicode 13.0 (beta) is supported

Using the beta causes us to participate in the soak cycle for
Unicode.  Final approval for the existing changes has been made by the
Unicode consortium, and there are few possibilities that this could
break existing programs, as there are few changes to already existing
characters.

Information about the changes is at
L<https://unicode.org/versions/beta-13.0.0.html>.

=head2 New Unicode properties C<Identifier_Status> and C<Identifier_Type> supported

Unicode is in the process of revising its regular expression
requirements: L<https://www.unicode.org/draft/reports/tr18/tr18.html>.
As part of that they are wanting more properties to be exposed, ones
that aren't part of the strict UCD (Unicode character database).  These
two are used for examining inputs for security purposes.  Details on
their usage is at L<https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/proposed.html>.

=head2 It is now possible to write C<qr/\p{Name=...}/>, or C<\p{Na=...}>

The Unicode Name property is now accessible in regular expression
patterns using the above syntaxes, as an alternative to C<\N{...}>.
A comparison of the two methods is given in
L<perlunicode/Comparison of \N{...} and \p{name=...}>.

=head2 The C<POSIX::mblen()> function now works on shift state locales
and is thread-safe on C99 and above compilers
when executed on a platform that has locale thread-safety.

This function is always executed under the current C language locale.
(See L<perllocale>.)  Most locales are stateless, but a few, notably the
very rarely encountered ISO 2022, maintain a state between calls to this
function.  Previously the state was cleared on every call to this
function, but now the state is not reset unless the first parameter is
C<undef>.

On threaded perls, the C99 function L<mbrlen(3)>,
when available, is substituted for plain
C<mblen>.
This makes this function thread-safe when executing on a locale
thread-safe platform.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Stop pretending C<POSIX::mbstowcs> and C<POSIX::wcstombs> are
supported

These functions could never have worked due to a defective interface
specification.  There is clearly no demand for them, given that no one
has ever complained in the many years the functions were claimed to be
available, hence so-called "support" for them is now dropped.

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if not applicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

=head2 Updated Modules and Pragmata

=over 4

=item *

L<IO> has been upgraded from version 1.42 to 1.43.

L<IO::Socket> no longer caches a zero protocol value, since this
indicates that the implementation will select a protocol.  This means
that on platforms that don't implement C<SO_PROTOCOL> for a given
socket type the protocol method may return C<undef>.

=item *

L<Storable> has been upgraded from version 3.18 to 3.19.

Use of note() from Test::More is now optional in tests.  This works
around a circular dependency with Test::More when installing on very
old perls from CPAN.

L<threads> has been upgraded from version 2.23 to 2.24.

the text of the resolution has been clarified.

L<Use of code point 0x%s is not allowed; the permissible max is 0x%X|perldiag/"Use of code point 0x%s is not allowed; the permissible max is 0x%X">

L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the C<perlthanks> program:

    perlthanks

This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
