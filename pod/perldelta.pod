=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.35.11

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.35.10 release and the 5.35.11
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.35.9, first read
L<perl53510delta>, which describes differences between 5.35.9 and 5.35.10.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 New functions C<builtin::created_as_string> and C<builtin::created_as_number>

These new functions allow code to inspect whether a defined but non-referential
scalar value originated from an expression that was string-like in nature, or
number-like.  While most uses within Perl should not care about such
distinctions, this can be useful when serialising or encoding Perl data
structures for export to other languages or data formats where such a
distinction does matter.

=head2 Support for not sharing all keys in large hash tables.

This release includes support to build Perl so that it does not share
all keys in hash tables as has been historically the case since Perl
v5.6. The shared key behavior was added to Perl originally to support
having many objects with the same keys without having to store each key
many times. For objects that might be created hundreds or thousands of
times this key sharing behavior can result in using significantly less
memory. However key sharing comes at the cost of having to maintain an
internal "master hash table" (PL_str_tab), and having to do two store
operations per key stored in a hash table. It also can result in
surprising consequences with programs that fork, causing the master hash
table to be COWed (copy on write) into the memory space for each forked
process which can, in worst case, greatly increase the memory
utilization of such scripts.

The new behavior is an attempt to have our cake and eat it too. Small
hash tables will continue to share keys, but once the hash table is used
to store more than a certain number of keys (currently 64) it will not
share the new keys that are added. This should benefit scripts that
build large hash tables, especially those that do so in forked sub-
processes. The unshared mode is triggered when the hash table is resized
which is non-deterministic and depends on the underlying hash function
that perl has been built with and the seed used by the current process
so the exact circumstances when this new mode will be enabled for a
given hash will vary between different invocations of a script.

We are uncertain of the exact effects of this new mode and are keen to
get field reports about the consequences of enabling it. We know that in
many cases not sharing keys speeds up scripts in general, and may result
in a reduction in memory consumption. Code that builds large hashes
where the keys are stored in only one hash, for instance where the keys
are message digests, will likely benefit from this change by being
faster and using less memory. However there are also circumstances where
not sharing keys can significantly increase memory consumption, such as
where large numbers of keys are stored in multiple hash tables at once.
We have data to suggest that not sharing keys will reduce COW churn and
overall memory consumption in scripts that fork and construct large hash
tables, however such scripts may also encounter a modest speed penalty.
Overall the consequences of not sharing keys will vary depending on
workload, however we believe that broadly speaking enabling this feature
will be beneficial for most of our users. We would like to get data from
the field to validate our assumptions.

We are not enabling the new mode by default in this release as we want
to gather more data and obtain feedback from the field about how it
affects people's scripts, but our intention is to ship the next release
of Perl, version 5.38, with some form of this functionality enabled. We
are hopeful that people will try to build their perls with this feature
and provide us feedback on the results. This will help guide our next
steps. So please try it and send feedback to the porters mailing list.

You can enable this new feature by passing

    -Accflags='-DPERL_USE_UNSHARED_KEYS_IN_LARGE_HASHES'

to F<Configure> during the Configuration process.

Big thanks to Nicholas Clark for all the hard work in implementing this
new feature.

vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if not applicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)
