=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.26.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes the differences between the 5.24.0 release and the
5.26.0 release.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 New regular expression modifier C</xx>

Specifying two C<x> characters to modify a regular expression pattern
does everything that a single one does, but additionally TAB and SPACE
characters within a bracketed character class are generally ignored and
can be added to improve readability, like
S<C</[ ^ A-Z d-f p-x ]/xx>>.  Details are at
L<perlre/E<sol>x and E<sol>xx>.

=head2 New Hash Function For 64-bit Builds

We have switched to a hybrid hash function to better balance
performance for short and long keys.

For short keys, 16 bytes and under, we use an optimised variant of
One At A Time Hard, and for longer keys we use Siphash 1-3. For very
long keys this is a big improvement in performance. For shorter keys
there is a modest improvement.

=head2 Indented Here-documents

This adds a new modifier '~' to here-docs that tells the parser
that it should look for /^\s*$DELIM\n/ as the closing delimiter.

These syntaxes are all supported:

    <<~EOF;
    <<~\EOF;
    <<~'EOF';
    <<~"EOF";
    <<~`EOF`;
    <<~ 'EOF';
    <<~ "EOF";
    <<~ `EOF`;

The '~' modifier will strip, from each line in the here-doc, the
same whitespace that appears before the delimiter.

Newlines will be copied as is, and lines that don't include the
proper beginning whitespace will cause perl to croak.

For example:

    if (1) {
      print <<~EOF;
        Hello there
        EOF
    }

prints "Hello there\n" with no leading whitespace.

=head2 '.' and @INC

Perl now provides a way to build perl without C<.> in @INC by default. If you
want this feature, you can build with -Ddefault_inc_excludes_dot

Because the testing / make process for perl modules do not function well with
C<.> missing from @INC, Perl now supports the environment variable
PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC=1 which makes Perl behave as it previously did, returning
C<.> to @INC in all child processes.

WARNING: C<PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC> has been provided during the perl 5.25
development cycle and is not guaranteed to function in perl 5.26.

=head2 create a safer utf8_hop() called utf8_hop_safe()

Unlike utf8_hop(), utf8_hop_safe() won't navigate before the beginning or after
the end of the supplied buffer.

=head2 @{^CAPTURE}, %{^CAPTURE}, and %{^CAPTURE_ALL}

C<@{^CAPTURE}> exposes the capture buffers of the last match as an
array. So C<$1> is C<${^CAPTURE}[0]>.

C<%{^CAPTURE}> is the equivalent to C<%+> (ie named captures)

C<%{^CAPTURE_ALL}> is the equivalent to C<%-> (ie all named captures).

=head2 Unicode 9.0 is now supported

A list of changes is at L<http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode9.0.0/>.
Modules that are shipped with core Perl but not maintained by p5p do not
necessarily support Unicode 9.0.  L<Unicode::Normalize> does work on 9.0.

=head2 Use of C<\p{I<script>}> uses the improved Script_Extensions property

Unicode 6.0 introduced an improved form of the Script (C<sc>) property, and
called it Script_Extensions (C<scx>).  As of now, Perl uses this improved
version when a property is specified as just C<\p{I<script>}>.  The meaning of
compound forms, like C<\p{sc=I<script>}> are unchanged.  This should make
programs be more accurate when determining if a character is used in a given
script, but there is a slight chance of breakage for programs that very
specifically needed the old behavior.  See L<perlunicode/Scripts>.

=head2 Declaring a reference to a variable

As an experimental feature, Perl now allows the referencing operator to come
after L<C<my()>|perlfunc/my>, L<C<state()>|perlfunc/state>,
L<C<our()>|perlfunc/our>, or L<C<local()>|perlfunc/local>.  This syntax must
be enabled with C<use feature 'declared_refs'>.  It is experimental, and will
warn by default unless C<no warnings 'experimental::refaliasing'> is in effect.
It is intended mainly for use in assignments to references.  For example:

    use experimental 'refaliasing', 'declared_refs';
    my \$a = \$b;

See L<perlref/Assigning to References> for slightly more detail.

=head2 Perl can now do default collation in UTF-8 locales on platforms
that support it

Some platforms natively do a reasonable job of collating and sorting in
UTF-8 locales.  Perl now works with those.  For portability and full
control, L<Unicode::Collate> is still recommended, but now you may
not need to do anything special to get good-enough results, depending on
your application.  See
L<perllocale/Category C<LC_COLLATE>: Collation: Text Comparisons and Sorting>.

=head2 Better locale collation of strings containing embedded C<NUL>
characters

In locales that have multi-level character weights, these are now
ignored at the higher priority ones.  There are still some gotchas in
some strings, though.  See
L<perllocale/Collation of strings containing embedded C<NUL> characters>.

=head2 Lexical subroutines are no longer experimental

Using the C<lexical_subs> feature no longer emits a warning. Existing
code that disables the C<experimental::lexical_subs> warning category
that the feature previously used will continue to work. The
C<lexical_subs> feature has no effect; all Perl code can use lexical
subroutines, regardless of what feature declarations are in scope.

=head2 C<CORE> subroutines for hash and array functions callable via
reference

The hash and array functions in the C<CORE> namespace--C<keys>, C<each>,
C<values>, C<push>, C<pop>, C<shift>, C<unshift> and C<splice>--, can now
be called with ampersand syntax (C<&CORE::keys(\%hash>) and via reference
(C<< my $k = \&CORE::keys; $k-E<gt>(\%hash) >>).  Previously they could only be
used when inlined.

=head2 POSIX::tmpnam() has been removed

The fundamentally unsafe C<tmpnam()> interface was deprecated in
Perl 5.22.0 and has now been removed.  In its place you can use
for example the L<File::Temp> interfaces.

=head2 require ::Foo::Bar is now illegal.

Formerly, C<require ::Foo::Bar> would try to read F</Foo/Bar.pm>. Now any
bareword require which starts with a double colon dies instead.

=head2 Unescaped literal C<"{"> characters in regular expression
patterns are no longer permissible

You have to now say something like C<"\{"> or C<"[{]"> to specify to
match a LEFT CURLY BRACKET.  This will allow future extensions to the
language.  This restriction is not enforced, nor are there current plans
to enforce it, if the C<"{"> is the first character in the pattern.

These have been deprecated since v5.16, with a deprecation message
displayed starting in v5.22.

=head2 Literal control character variable names are no longer permissible

A variable name may no longer contain a literal control character under
any circumstances.  These previously were allowed in single-character
names on ASCII platforms, but have been deprecated there since Perl
v5.20.  This affects things like C<$I<\cT>>, where I<\cT> is a literal
control (such as a C<NAK> or C<NEGATIVE ACKNOWLEDGE> character) in the
source code.

=head2 C<NBSP> is no longer permissible in C<\N{...}>

The name of a character may no longer contain non-breaking spaces.  It
has been deprecated to do so since Perl v5.22.

=head1 Security

=head2 Remove current dir (C<.>) from C<@INC>

For security reasons, C<@INC> no longer contains the default directory
(C<.>).

=head2 "Escaped" colons and relative paths in PATH

On Unix systems, Perl treats any relative paths in the PATH environment
variable as tainted when starting a new process.  Previously, it was
allowing a backslash to escape a colon (unlike the OS), consequently
allowing relative paths to be considered safe if the PATH was set to
something like C</\:.>.  The check has been fixed to treat C<.> as tainted
in that example.

=head2 C<-Di> switch is now required for PerlIO debugging output

Previously PerlIO debugging output would be sent to the file specified
by the C<PERLIO_DEBUG> environment variable if perl wasn't running
setuid and the C<-T> or C<-t> switches hadn't been parsed yet.

If perl performed output at a point where it hadn't yet parsed its
switches this could result in perl creating or overwriting the file
named by C<PERLIO_DEBUG> even when the C<-T> switch had been supplied.

Perl now requires the C<-Di> switch to produce PerlIO debugging
output.  By default this is written to C<stderr>, but can optionally
be redirected to a file by setting the C<PERLIO_DEBUG> environment
variable.

If perl is running setuid or the C<-T> switch has supplied
C<PERLIO_DEBUG> is ignored and the debugging output is sent to
C<stderr> as for any other C<-D> switch.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 C<${^ENCODING}> has been removed

Consequently, the L<encoding> pragma's default mode is no longer supported.  If
you still need to write your source code in encodings other than UTF-8, use a
source filter such as L<Filter::Encoding> on CPAN or L<encoding>'s C<Filter>
option.

=head2 C<scalar(%hash)> return signature changed

The value returned for C<scalar(%hash)> will no longer show information about
the buckets allocated in the hash.  It will simply return the count of used
keys.  It is thus equivalent to C<0+keys(%hash)>.

A form of backwards compatibility is provided via C<Hash::Util::bucket_ratio()>
which provides the same behavior as C<scalar(%hash)> provided prior to Perl
5.25.

=head2 C<keys> returned from an lvalue subroutine

C<keys> returned from an lvalue subroutine can no longer be assigned
to in list context.

    sub foo : lvalue { keys(%INC) }
    (foo) = 3; # death
    sub bar : lvalue { keys(@_) }
    (bar) = 3; # also an error

This makes the lvalue sub case consistent with C<(keys %hash) = ...> and
C<(keys @_) = ...>, which are also errors.  [perl #128187]

=head1 Deprecations

=head2 String delimiters that aren't stand-alone graphemes are now deprecated

In order for Perl to eventually allow string delimiters to be Unicode
grapheme clusters (which look like a single character, but may be
a sequence of several ones), we have to stop allowing a single char
delimiter that isn't a grapheme by itself.  These are unlikely to exist
in actual code, as they would typically display as attached to the
character in front of them.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

=over 4

=item *

A hash in boolean context is now sometimes faster, e.g.

    if (!%h) { ... }

This was already special-cased, but some cases were missed, and even the
ones which weren't have been improved.

=item *

Several other ops may now also be faster in boolean context.

=item * New Faster Hash Function on 64 bit builds

We use a different hash function for short and long keys. This should
improve performance and security, especially for long keys.

=item * readline is faster

Reading from a file line-by-line with C<readline()> or C<< E<lt>E<gt> >> should
now typically be faster due to a better implementation of the code that
searches for the next newline character.

=item *

Reduce cost of SvVALID().

=item *

C<$ref1 = $ref2> has been optimized.

=item *

Array and hash assignment are now faster, e.g.

    (..., @a) = (...);
    (..., %h) = (...);

especially when the RHS is empty.

=item *

Reduce the number of odd special cases for the C<SvSCREAM> flag.

=item *

Avoid sv_catpvn() in do_vop() when unneeded.

=item *

Enhancements in Regex concat COW implementation.

=item *

Speed up C<AV> and C<HV> clearing/undeffing.

=item *

Better optimise array and hash assignment

=item *

Converting a single-digit string to a number is now substantially faster.

=item *

The internal op implementing the C<split> builtin has been simplified and
sped up. Firstly, it no longer requires a subsidiary internal C<pushre> op
to do its work. Secondly, code of the form C<my @x = split(...)> is now
optimised in the same way as C<@x = split(...)>, and is therefore a few
percent faster.

=item *

The rather slow implementation for the experimental subroutine signatures
feature has been made much faster; it is now comparable in speed with the
old-style C<my ($a, $b, @c) = @_>.

=item *

Bareword constant strings are now permitted to take part in constant
folding. They were originally exempted from constant folding in August 1999,
during the development of Perl 5.6, to ensure that C<use strict "subs">
would still apply to bareword constants. That has now been accomplished a
different way, so barewords, like other constants, now gain the performance
benefits of constant folding.

This also means that void-context warnings on constant expressions of
barewords now report the folded constant operand, rather than the operation;
this matches the behaviour for non-bareword constants.

unescaped uses of the two characters C<}> and C<]> in regular
expression patterns (outside bracketed character classes) that are taken
literally.  This brings them more in line with the C<)> character which
is always a metacharacter unless escaped.  Being a metacharacter only
sometimes, depending on action at a distance, can lead to silently
having the pattern mean something quite different than was intended,
which the S<C<re 'strict'>> mode is intended to minimize.

=head1 Documentation

=head2 New Documentation

=head3 L<perldeprecation>

This file documents all upcoming deprecations, and some of the deprecations
which already have been removed. The purpose of this documentation is
two-fold: document what will disappear, and by which version, and serve
as a guide for people dealing with code which has features that no longer
work after an upgrade of their perl.

=head2 Changes to Existing Documentation

=head3 L<perlcall>

=item *

Use of unassigned code point or non-standalone grapheme for a delimiter will be a fatal error starting in Perl 5.30

This was changed to drop a leading C<v> in C<v5.30>, so it uses the same
style as other deprecation messages.

"\c%c" is more clearly written simply as "%s".

It was decided to undeprecate the use of C<\c%c>, see L<http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2017/02/msg242944.html>

Long lines in the message body are now wrapped at 900 characters, to stay
well within the 1000-character limit imposed by SMTP mail transfer agents.
This is particularly likely to be important for the list of arguments to

C<DEFAULT_INC_EXCLUDES_DOT> has been turned on as default.

=item *

The C<dtrace> build process has further changes:

=over

=item *

If the C<-xnolibs> is available, use that so a F<dtrace> perl can be
built within a FreeBSD jail.

=item *

On systems that build a dtrace object file (FreeBSD, Solaris and
SystemTap's dtrace emulation), copy the input objects to a separate
directory and process them there, and use those objects in the link,
since C<dtrace -G> also modifies these objects.

=item *

Add libelf to the build on FreeBSD 10.x, since dtrace adds references
to libelf symbols.

=item *

Generate a dummy dtrace_main.o if C<dtrace -G> fails to build it.  A
default build on Solaris generates probes from the unused inline
functions, while they don't on FreeBSD, which causes C<dtrace -G> to
fail.

=back

[perl #130108]

=item *

You can now disable perl's use of the PERL_HASH_SEED and
PERL_PERTURB_KEYS environment variables by configuring perl with

You can now disable perl's use of the PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG environment
variable by configuring perl with
C<-Accflags=-DNO_PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG>.

=item *

Zero out the alignment bytes when calculating the bytes for 80-bit C<NaN>
and C<Inf> to make builds more reproducible. [perl #130133]

=item *

Since 5.18 for testing purposes we have included support for
building perl with a variety of non-standard, and non-recommended
hash functions. Since we do not recommend the use of these functions
we have removed them and their corresponding build options. Specifically
this includes the following build options:

    PERL_HASH_FUNC_SDBM
    PERL_HASH_FUNC_DJB2
    PERL_HASH_FUNC_SUPERFAST
    PERL_HASH_FUNC_MURMUR3
    PERL_HASH_FUNC_ONE_AT_A_TIME
    PERL_HASH_FUNC_ONE_AT_A_TIME_OLD
    PERL_HASH_FUNC_MURMUR_HASH_64A
    PERL_HASH_FUNC_MURMUR_HASH_64B

=item *

Remove "Warning: perl appears in your path"

This install warning is more or less obsolete, since most platforms already
*will* have a /usr/bin/perl or similar provided by the OS.

=item *

Reduce verbosity of "make install.man"

Previously, two progress messages were emitted for each manpage: one by
installman itself, and one by the function in install_lib.pl that it calls to
actually install the file. Disabling the second of those in each case saves
over 750 lines of unhelpful output.

=item *

Cleanup for clang -Weverything support. [perl 129961]

=item *

Configure: signbit scan was assuming too much, stop assuming negative 0.

=item *

Various compiler warnings have been silenced.

=item *

Several smaller changes have been made to remove impediments to compiling under
C++11.

Builds using C<USE_PAD_RESET> now work again; this configuration had
bit-rotted.

=item *

A probe for C<gai_strerror> was added to F<Configure> that checks if the
the gai_strerror() routine is available and can be used to
translate error codes returned by getaddrinfo() into human
readable strings.

F<Configure> now aborts if both "-Duselongdouble" and "-Dusequadmath" are
requested.
L<[perl #126203]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=126203>

if it was already present.
L<[perl #128538]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128538>

=item *

Clang builds with "-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT" or "-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT_PRIVATE" have
been fixed (by disabling Thread Safety Analysis for these configurations).

=item *

F<make_ext.pl> no longer updates a module's F<pm_to_blib> file when no
files require updates.  This could cause dependencies, F<perlmain.c>
in particular, to be rebuilt unnecessarily.  [perl #126710]

=item *

The output of C<perl -V> has been reformatted so that each configuration
and compile-time option is now listed one per line, to improve
readability.

=item *

C<Configure> now builds C<miniperl> and C<generate_uudmap> if you
invoke it with C<-Dusecrosscompiler> but not C<-Dtargethost=somehost>.
This means you can supply your target platform C<config.sh>, generate
the headers and proceed to build your cross-target perl.  [perl #127234]

=item *

Builds with C<-Accflags=-DPERL_TRACE_OPS> now only dump the operator
counts when the environment variable C<PERL_TRACE_OPS> to be set to a
non-zero integer.  This allows C<make test> to pass on such a build.

=item *

When building with GCC 6 and link-time optimization (the C<-flto> option to
C<gcc>), C<Configure> was treating all probed symbols as present on the
system, regardless of whether they actually exist. This has been fixed.
[perl #128131]

=item *

The F<t/test.pl> library is used for internal testing of Perl itself, and
also copied by several CPAN modules. Some of those modules must work on
older versions of Perl, so F<t/test.pl> must in turn avoid newer Perl
features. Compatibility with Perl 5.8 was inadvertently removed some time
ago; it has now been restored. [perl #128052]

The build process no longer emits an extra blank line before building each
"simple" extension (those with only F<*.pm> and F<*.pod> files).

=item *

F<XS-APItest/t/utf8.t>: Several small fixes and enhancements.

=item *

Tests for locales were erroneously using locales incompatible with Perl.

=item *

Some parts of the test suite that try to exhaustively test edge cases in the
regex implementation have been restricted to running for a maximum of five
minutes. On slow systems they could otherwise take several hours, without
significantly improving our understanding of the correctness of the code
under test.

In addition, some of those test cases have been split into more files, to
allow them to be run in parallel on suitable systems.

=item *

A new internal facility allows analysing the time taken by the individual
tests in Perl's own test suite; see F<Porting/harness-timer-report.pl>.

=item *

F<t/re/regexp_nonull.t> has been added to test that the regular expression
engine can handle scalars that do not have a null byte just past the end of
the string.

=item *

A new test script, F<t/op/decl-refs.t>, has been added to test the new feature,
"Declaring a reference to a variable".

=item *

A new test script, F<t/re/anyof.t>, has been added to test that the ANYOF nodes
generated by bracketed character classes are as expected.

Perl now compiles under NetBSD on VAX machines.  However, it's not

NaNs compatibly with most modern systems, which implement the IEEE-754
floating point standard.  The hexadecimal floating point (C<0x...p[+-]n>
literals, C<printf %a>) is not implemented, either.

=item VMS

=over 4

=item *

The path separator for the C<PERL5LIB> and C<PERLLIB> environment entries is
now a colon (C<:>) when running under a Unix shell. There is no change when
running under DCL (it's still C<|>).

=item *

Remove some VMS-specific hacks from C<showlex.t>. These were added 15 years
ago, and are no longer necessary for any VMS version now supported.

=item *

Move C<_pDEPTH> and C<_aDEPTH> after F<config.h> otherwise DEBUGGING
may not be defined yet.

=item *

VAXC has not been a possibility for a good long while, and the versions of the
DEC/Compaq/HP/VSI C compiler that report themselves as "DEC" in a listing file
are 15 years or more out-of-date and can be safely desupported.

=back

=item Windows

=over 4

=item *

Support for compiling perl on Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
(containing Visual C++ 14.0) has been added.

This version of VC++ includes a completely rewritten C run-time library, some
of the changes in which mean that work done to resolve a socket close() bug in
perl #120091 and perl #118059 is not workable in its current state with this
version of VC++.  Therefore, we have effectively reverted that bug fix for
VS2015 onwards on the basis that being able to build with VS2015 onwards is
more important than keeping the bug fix.  We may revisit this in the future to
attempt to fix the bug again in a way that is compatible with VS2015.

These changes do not affect compilation with GCC or with Visual Studio versions
up to and including VS2013, i.e. the bug fix is retained (unchanged) for those
compilers.

Note that you may experience compatibility problems if you mix a perl built
with GCC or VS E<lt>= VS2013 with XS modules built with VS2015, or if you mix a
perl built with VS2015 with XS modules built with GCC or VS E<lt>= VS2013.
Some incompatibility may arise because of the bug fix that has been reverted
for VS2015 builds of perl, but there may well be incompatibility anyway because
of the rewritten CRT in VS2015 (e.g. see discussion at
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30412951).

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

The C<op_class()> API function has been added. This is like the existing
C<OP_CLASS()> macro, but can more accurately determine what struct an op
has been allocated as. For example C<OP_CLASS()> might return
C<OA_BASEOP_OR_UNOP> indicating that ops of this type are usually
allocated as an C<OP> or C<UNOP>; while C<op_class()> will return
C<OPclass_BASEOP> or C<OPclass_UNOP> as appropriate.

=item *

The output format of the C<op_dump()> function (as used by C<perl -Dx>)
has changed: it now displays an "ASCII-art" tree structure, and shows more
low-level details about each op, such as its address and class.

=item *

New versions of macros like C<isALPHA_utf8> and C<toLOWER_utf8>  have
been added, each with the
suffix C<_safe>, like C<isSPACE_utf8_safe>.  These take an extra
parameter, giving an upper limit of how far into the string it is safe
to read.  Using the old versions could cause attempts to read beyond the
end of the input buffer if the UTF-8 is not well-formed, and their use
now raises a deprecation warning.  Details are at
L<perlapi/Character classification>.

=item *

Calling macros like C<isALPHA_utf8> on malformed UTF-8 have issued a
deprecation warning since Perl v5.18.  They now die.
Similarly, macros like C<toLOWER_utf8> on malformed UTF-8 now die.

=item *

Calling the functions C<utf8n_to_uvchr> and its derivatives, while
passing a string length of 0 is now asserted against in DEBUGGING
builds, and otherwise returns the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER.   If
you have nothing to decode, you shouldn't call the decode function.

=item *

The functions C<utf8n_to_uvchr> and its derivatives now return the
Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER if called with UTF-8 that has the overlong
malformation, and that malformation is allowed by the input parameters.
This malformation is where the UTF-8 looks valid syntactically, but
there is a shorter sequence that yields the same code point.  This has
been forbidden since Unicode version 3.1.

=item *

The functions C<utf8n_to_uvchr> and its derivatives now accept an input
flag to allow the overflow malformation.  This malformation is when the
UTF-8 may be syntactically valid, but the code point it represents is
not capable of being represented in the word length on the platform.
What "allowed" means in this case is that the function doesn't return an
error, and advances the parse pointer to beyond the UTF-8 in question,
but it returns the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER as the value of the
code point (since the real value is not representable).

=item *

The C<PADOFFSET> type has changed from being unsigned to signed, and
several pad-related variables such as C<PL_padix> have changed from being
of type C<I32> to type C<PADOFFSET>.

=item *

The function C<L<perlapi/utf8n_to_uvchr>> has been changed to not
abandon searching for other malformations when the first one is
encountered.  A call to it thus can generate multiple diagnostics,
instead of just one.

=item *

A new function, C<L<perlapi/utf8n_to_uvchr_error>>, has been added for
use by modules that need to know the details of UTF-8 malformations
beyond pass/fail.  Previously, the only ways to know why a sequence was
ill-formed was to capture and parse the generated diagnostics, or to do
your own analysis.

=item *

Several new functions for handling Unicode have been added to the API:
C<L<perlapi/is_strict_utf8_string>>,
C<L<perlapi/is_c9strict_utf8_string>>,
C<L<perlapi/is_utf8_string_flags>>,
C<L<perlapi/is_strict_utf8_string_loc>>,
C<L<perlapi/is_strict_utf8_string_loclen>>,
C<L<perlapi/is_c9strict_utf8_string_loc>>,
C<L<perlapi/is_c9strict_utf8_string_loclen>>,
C<L<perlapi/is_utf8_string_loc_flags>>,
C<L<perlapi/is_utf8_string_loclen_flags>>,
C<L<perlapi/is_utf8_fixed_width_buf_flags>>,
C<L<perlapi/is_utf8_fixed_width_buf_loc_flags>>,
C<L<perlapi/is_utf8_fixed_width_buf_loclen_flags>>.

These functions are all extensions of the C<is_utf8_string_*()> functions,
that apply various restrictions to the UTF-8 recognized as valid.

=item *

A new API function C<sv_setvpv_bufsize()> allows simultaneously setting the
length and allocated size of the buffer in an C<SV>, growing the buffer if
necessary.

=item *

A new API macro C<SvPVCLEAR()> sets its C<SV> argument to an empty string,
like Perl-space C<$x = ''>, but with several optimisations.

=item *

All parts of the internals now agree that the C<sassign> op is a C<BINOP>;
previously it was listed as a C<BASEOP> in F<regen/opcodes>, which meant
that several parts of the internals had to be special-cased to accommodate
it. This oddity's original motivation was to handle code like C<$x ||= 1>;
that is now handled in a simpler way.

=item *

Several new internal C macros have been added that take a string literal as
arguments, alongside existing routines that take the equivalent value as two
arguments, a character pointer and a length. The advantage of this is that
the length of the string is calculated automatically, rather than having to
be done manually. These routines are now used where appropriate across the
entire codebase.

=item *

The code in F<gv.c> that determines whether a variable has a special meaning
to Perl has been simplified.

=item *

The C<DEBUGGING>-mode output for regex compilation and execution has been
enhanced.

=item *

Several macros and functions have been added to the public API for
dealing with Unicode and UTF-8-encoded strings.  See
L<perlapi/Unicode Support>.

=item *

Use C<my_strlcat()> in C<locale.c>. While C<strcat()> is safe in this context,
some compilers were optimizing this to C<strcpy()> causing a porting test to
fail that looks for unsafe code. Rather than fighting this, we just use
C<my_strlcat()> instead.

=item *

Three new ops, C<OP_ARGELEM>, C<OP_ARGDEFELEM> and C<OP_ARGCHECK> have
been added. These are intended principally to implement the individual
elements of a subroutine signature, plus any overall checking required.

=item *

Perl no longer panics when switching into some locales on machines with
buggy C<strxfrm()> implementations in their libc. [perl #121734]

=item *

Perl is now built with the C<PERL_OP_PARENT> compiler define enabled by
default. To disable it, use the C<PERL_NO_OP_PARENT> compiler define.
This flag alters how the C<op_sibling> field is used in C<OP> structures,
and has been available optionally since perl 5.22.0.

See L<perl5220delta/"Internal Changes"> for more details of what this
build option does.

=item *

The meanings of some internal SV flags have been changed

OPpRUNTIME, SVpbm_VALID, SVpbm_TAIL, SvTAIL_on, SvTAIL_off, SVrepl_EVAL,
SvEVALED

=item *

Change C<hv_fetch(…, "…", …, …)> to C<hv_fetchs(…, "…", …)>

The dual-life dists all use Devel::PPPort, so they can use this function even
though it was only added in 5.10.

=item *

C< $-{$name} > would leak an C<AV> on each access if the regular
expression had no named captures.  The same applies to access to any
hash tied with L<Tie::Hash::NamedCapture> and C<< all =E<gt> 1 >>. [perl
#130822]

=item *

Attempting to use the deprecated variable C<$#> as the object in an
indirect object method call could cause a heap use after free or
buffer overflow.  [perl #129274]

=item *

When checking for an indirect object method call in some rare cases
the parser could reallocate the line buffer but then continue to use
pointers to the old buffer.  [perl #129190]

=item *

Supplying a glob as the format argument to L<perlfunc/formline> would
cause an assertion failure.  [perl #130722]

=item *

Code like C< $value1 =~ qr/.../ ~~ $value2 > would have the match
converted into a qr// operator, leaving extra elements on the stack to
confuse any surrounding expression.  [perl #130705]

=item *

Since 5.24.0 in some obscure cases, a regex which included code blocks
from multiple sources (e.g. via embedded via qr// objects) could end up
with the wrong current pad and crash or give weird results. [perl #129881]

=item *

Occasionally C<local()>s in a code block within a patterns weren't being
undone when the pattern matching backtracked over the code block.
[perl #126697]

=item *

Using C<substr()> to modify a magic variable could access freed memory
in some cases.  [perl #129340]

=item *

Perl 5.25.9 was fixed so that under C<use utf8>, the entire Perl program
is checked that the UTF-8 is wellformed.  It turns out that several edge
cases were missed, and are now fixed.  [perl #126310] was the original
ticket.

=item *

Under C<use utf8>, the entire Perl program is now checked that the UTF-8
is wellformed.  This resolves [perl #126310].

=item *

The range operator C<..> on strings now handles its arguments correctly when in
the scope of the L<< C<unicode_strings>|feature/"The 'unicode_strings' feature" >>
feature. The previous behaviour was sufficiently unexpected that we believe no
correct program could have made use of it.

=item *

The S<split> operator did not ensure enough space was allocated for
its return value in scalar context.  It could then write a single
pointer immediately beyond the end of the memory block allocated for
the stack.  [perl #130262]

=item *

Using a large code point with the C<W> pack template character with
the current output position aligned at just the right point could
cause a write a single zero byte immediately beyond the end of an
allocated buffer.  [perl #129149]

=item *

Supplying the form picture argument as part of the form argument list
where the picture specifies modifying the argument could cause an
access to the new freed compiled form.  [perl #129125]

=item *

Fix a problem with sort's build-in compare, where it would not sort
correctly with 64-bit integers, and non-long doubles. [perl #130335]

[perl #130495].

=item *

F<perldb> now ignores F</dev/tty> on non-Unix systems. [perl #113960];

=item *

Ensure range-start is set after error in C<tr///>. [perl #129342].

=item *

Don't read past start of string for unmatched backref; otherwise,
we may have heap buffer overflow. [perl #129377].

=item *

Properly recognize mathematical digit ranges starting at U+1D7E.
C<use re 'strict'> is supposed to warn if you use a range whose start
and end digit aren't from the same group of 10. It didn't do that
for five groups of mathematical digits starting at U+1D7E.

=item *

A sub containing a "forward" declaration with the same name (e.g.,
C<sub c { sub c; }>) could sometimes crash or loop infinitely.  [perl
#129090]

=item *

A crash in executing a regex with a floating UTF-8 substring against a
target string that also used UTF-8 has been fixed. [perl #129350]

=item *

Previously, a shebang line like C<#!perl -i u> could be erroneously
interpreted as requesting the C<-u> option. This has been fixed. [perl
#129336]

=item *

The regex engine was previously producing incorrect results in some rare
situations when backtracking past a trie that matches only one thing; this
showed up as capture buffers (C<$1>, C<$2>, etc) erroneously containing data
from regex execution paths that weren't actually executed for the final
match.  [perl #129897]

=item *

Certain regexes making use of the experimental C<regex_sets> feature could
trigger an assertion failure. This has been fixed. [perl #129322]

=item *

Invalid assignments to a reference constructor (e.g., C<\eval=time>) could
sometimes crash in addition to giving a syntax error.  [perl #125679]

=item *

The parser could sometimes crash if a bareword came after C<evalbytes>.
[perl #129196]

=item *

Autoloading via a method call would warn erroneously ("Use of inherited
AUTOLOAD for non-method") if there was a stub present in the package into
which the invocant had been blessed.  The warning is no longer emitted in
such circumstances.  [perl #47047]

=item *

A sub containing with a "forward" declaration with the same name (e.g.,
C<sub c { sub c; }>) could sometimes crash or loop infinitely.  [perl
#129090]

=item *

The use of C<splice> on arrays with nonexistent elements could cause other
operators to crash.  [perl #129164]

=item *

Fixed case where C<re_untuit_start> will overshoot the length of a utf8
string. [perl #129012]

=item *

Handle C<CXt_SUBST> better in C<Perl_deb_stack_all>, previously it wasn't
checking that the I<current> C<cx> is the right type, and instead was always
checking the base C<cx> (effectively a noop). [perl #129029]

=item *

Fixed two possible use-after-free bugs in C<Perl_yylex>. C<Perl_yylex>
maintains up to two pointers into the parser buffer, one of which can
become stale under the right conditions. [perl #129069]

=item *

Fixed a crash with C<s///l> where it thought it was dealing with UTF-8
when it wasn't. [perl #129038]

=item *

Fixed place where regex was not setting the syntax error correctly.
[perl #129122]

=item *

The C<&.> operator (and the C<&> operator, when it treats its arguments as
strings) were failing to append a trailing null byte if at least one string
was marked as utf8 internally.  Many code paths (system calls, regexp
compilation) still expect there to be a null byte in the string buffer
just past the end of the logical string.  An assertion failure was the
result.  [perl #129287]

=item *

Check C<pack_sockaddr_un()>'s return value because C<pack_sockaddr_un()>
silently truncates the supplied path if it won't fit into the C<sun_path>
member of C<sockaddr_un>. This may change in the future, but for now
check the path in theC<sockaddr> matches the desired path, and skip if
it doesn't. [perl #128095]

=item *

Make sure C<PL_oldoldbufptr> is preserved in C<scan_heredoc()>. In some
cases this is used in building error messages. [perl #128988]

=item *

Check for null PL_curcop in IN_LC() [perl #129106]

Fixed the parser error handling for an 'C<:attr(foo>' that does not have
an ending 'C<)>'.

Fix C<Perl_delimcpy()> to handle a backslash as last char, this
actually fixed two bugs, [perl #129064] and [perl #129176].

=item *

[perl #129267] rework gv_fetchmethod_pvn_flags separator parsing to
prevent possible string overrun with invalid len in gv.c

=item *

Problems with in-place array sorts: code like C<@a = sort { ... } @a>,
where the source and destination of the sort are the same plain array, are
optimised to do less copying around. Two side-effects of this optimisation
were that the contents of C<@a> as visible to to sort routine were
partially sorted, and under some circumstances accessing C<@a> during the
sort could crash the interpreter. Both these issues have been fixed, and
Sort functions see the original value of C<@a>.

=item *

Non-ASCII string delimiters are now reported correctly in error messages
for unterminated strings.  [perl #128701]

=item *

C<pack("p", ...)> used to emit its warning ("Attempt to pack pointer to
temporary value") erroneously in some cases, but has been fixed.

=item *

C<@DB::args> is now exempt from "used once" warnings.  The warnings only
occurred under B<-w>, because F<warnings.pm> itself uses C<@DB::args>
multiple times.

=item *

The use of built-in arrays or hash slices in a double-quoted string no
longer issues a warning ("Possible unintended interpolation...") if the
variable has not been mentioned before.  This affected code like
C<qq|@DB::args|> and C<qq|@SIG{'CHLD', 'HUP'}|>.  (The special variables
C<@-> and C<@+> were already exempt from the warning.)

=item *

C<gethostent> and similar functions now perform a null check internally, to
avoid crashing with torsocks.  This was a regression from 5.22.  [perl
#128740]

=item *

C<defined *{'!'}>, C<defined *{'['}>, and C<defined *{'-'}> no longer leak
memory if the typeglob in question has never been accessed before.

=item *

In 5.25.4 fchown() was changed not to accept negative one as an argument
because in some platforms that is an error.  However, in some other platforms
that is an acceptable argument.  This change has been reverted [perl #128967].

=item *

Mentioning the same constant twice in a row (which is a syntax error) no
longer fails an assertion under debugging builds.  This was a regression
from 5.20.  [perl #126482]

=item *

Many issues relating to C<printf "%a"> of hexadecimal floating point
were fixed.  In addition, the "subnormals" (formerly known as "denormals")
floating point anumbers are now supported both with the plain IEEE 754
floating point numbers (64-bit or 128-bit) and the x86 80-bit
"extended precision".  Note that subnormal hexadecimal floating
point literals will give a warning about "exponent underflow".
[perl #128843, #128889, #128890, #128893, #128909, #128919]

=item *

A regression in 5.24 with C<tr/\N{U+...}/foo/> when the code point was between
128 and 255 has been fixed. [perl #128734].

=item *

A regression from the previous development release, 5.23.3, where
compiling a regular expression could crash the interpreter has been
fixed. [perl #128686].

=item *

Use of a string delimiter whose code point is above 2**31 now works
correctly on platforms that allow this.  Previously, certain characters,
due to truncation, would be confused with other delimiter characters
with special meaning (such as C<?> in C<m?...?>), resulting
in inconsistent behaviour.  Note that this is non-portable,
and is based on Perl's extension to UTF-8, and is probably not
displayable nor enterable by any editor. [perl #128738]

=item *

C<@{x> followed by a newline where C<x> represents a control or non-ASCII
character no longer produces a garbled syntax error message or a crash.

Scalar C<keys %hash> can now be assigned to consistently in all scalar
lvalue contexts.  Previously it worked for some contexts but not others.

=item *

List assignment to C<vec> or C<substr> with an array or hash for its first
argument used to result in crashes or "Can't coerce" error messages at run
time, unlike scalar assignment, which would give an error at compile time.
List assignment now gives a compile-time error, too.  [perl #128260]

=item *

Expressions containing an C<&&> or C<||> operator (or their synonyms C<and>
and C<or>) were being compiled incorrectly in some cases. If the left-hand
side consisted of either a negated bareword constant or a negated C<do {}>
block containing a constant expression, and the right-hand side consisted of
a negated non-foldable expression, one of the negations was effectively
ignored. The same was true of C<if> and C<unless> statement modifiers,
though with the left-hand and right-hand sides swapped. This long-standing
bug has now been fixed. [perl #127952]

List assignment in list context where the LHS contained aggregates and
where there were not enough RHS elements, used to skip scalar lvalues.
Previously, C<(($a,$b,@c,$d) = (1))> in list context returned C<($a)>; now
it returns C<($a,$b,$d)>. C<(($a,$b,$c) = (1))> is unchanged: it still
returns C<($a,$b,$c)>. This can be seen in the following:

    sub inc { $_++ for @_ }
    inc(($a,$b,@c,$d) = (10))

Formerly, the values of C<($a,$b,$d)> would be left as C<(11,undef,undef)>;
now they are C<(11,1,1)>.

[perl 129903]

The basic problem is that code like this: /(?{ s!!! })/ can trigger infinite
recursion on the C stack (not the normal perl stack) when the last successful
pattern in scope is itself. Since the C stack overflows this manifests as an
untrappable error/segfault, which then kills perl.

We avoid the segfault by simply forbidding the use of the empty pattern when it
would resolve to the currently executing pattern.

=head1 Known Problems

=over 4

=item *

Some modules have been broken by the L<context stack rework|/Internal Changes>.
These modules were relying on non-guaranteed implementation details in perl.
Their maintainers have been informed, and should contact perl5-porters for
advice if needed.  Below is a subset of these modules:

=over 4

=item * L<Algorithm::Permute>

=item * L<Coro>

L<Coro> and perl v5.22.0 were already incompatible due to a change in the perl,
and the reworking on the perl context stack creates a further incompatibility.
perl5-porters has L<discussed the issue on the mailing
list|http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2016/05/msg236174.html>.

=item * L<Data::Alias>

=item * L<RPerl>

=item * L<Scope::Upper>

=item * L<TryCatch>

=back

=item *

The module L<lexical::underscore> no longer works on perl v5.24.0, because perl
no longer has a lexical C<$_>!

=item *

C<mod_perl> has been patched for compatibility for v5.22.0 and later but no
release has been made.  The relevant patch (and other changes) can be found in
their source code repository, L<mirrored at
GitHub|https://github.com/apache/mod_perl/commit/82827132efd3c2e25cc413c85af61bb63375da6e>.

=head1 Obituary

Jon Portnoy (AVENJ), a prolific Perl author and admired Gentoo community
member, has passed away on August 10, 2016. He will be remembered and
missed by all those with which he came in contact and enriched with his
intellect, wit, and spirit.

It is with great sadness we also note Kip Hampton's passing.. Probably
best known as the author of the Perl & XML column on XML.com, he was a
core contributor to AxKit, an XML server platform that became an Apache
Foundation project. He was a frequent speaker in the early days at
OSCON, and most recently at YAPC::NA in Madison. He was frequently on
irc.perl.org as `ubu`, generally in the #axkit-dahut community, the
group responsible for YAPC::NA Asheville in 2011.

Kip and his constant contributions to the community will be greatly
missed.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of
the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.
