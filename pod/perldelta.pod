=head1 Documentation

=head2 Changes to Existing Documentation

=head3 L<perlintro>

=over 4

=item *

A number of sentences in L<perlintro> have been simplified,
to make things clearer.
Ambiguities were resolved, related to "special variables".

=back


=head1 Platform Support

The :win32 IO layer has been removed. This experimental replacement for the
:unix layer never reached maturity in its nearly two decades of existence.

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

The API constant formerly named C<G_ARRAY>, indicating list context, has now
been renamed to a more accurate C<G_LIST>.  A compatibilty macro C<G_ARRAY> has
been added to allow existing code to work unaffected.  New code should be
written using the new constant instead.  This is supported by C<Devel::PPPort>
version 3.63.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

The flags on the OPTVAL parameter to setsockopt() were previously
checked before magic was called, possibly treating a numeric value as
a packed buffer or vice versa.  It also ignored the UTF-8 flag,
potentially treating the internal representation of an upgraded SV as
the bytes to supply to the setsockopt() system call.  (github L<#18660|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18660>)

=item *

Only set IOKp, not IOK on $) and $(.
This was issue L<#18955|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18955>: This will prevent serializers from serializing these
variables as numbers (which loses the additional groups).
This restores behaviour from 5.16
