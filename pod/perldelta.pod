=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.37.9

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.37.8 release and the 5.37.9
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.37.7, first read
L<perl5378delta>, which describes differences between 5.37.7 and 5.37.8.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 New C<class> Feature

A new B<experimental> syntax is now available for defining object classes,
where per-instance data is stored in "field" variables that behave like
lexicals.

    use feature 'class';

    class Point
    {
        field $x;
        field $y;

        method zero { $x = $y = 0; }
    }

This is described in more detail in L<perlclass>.  Notes on the internals of
its implementation and other related details can be found in L<perlclassguts>.

This remains a new and experimental feature, and is very much still under
development. It will be the subject of much further addition, refinement and
alteration in future releases.  As it is experimental, it yields warnings in
the C<experimental::class> category.  These can be silenced by a
C<no warnings> statement.

    use feature 'class';
    no warnings 'experimental::class';

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 (**{ ... }) removed from the regex engine.

This feature was released as part of 5.37.8, after some use and
discussion it was seen as more problematic than understood at first
and has been removed in 5.37.9. It was only ever present in a single
dev release and has never been released as part of a production perl,
thus no deprecation cycle has been performed.

=head1 Deprecations

=head2 Use of C<'> as a package name separator is deprecated

Using C<'> as package separator in a variable named in a double-quoted
string has warned since 5.28.  It is now deprecated in both string
interpolation and non-interpolated contexts, and will be removed in
Perl 5.40.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if not applicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed

There may well be none in a stable release.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

=item *

C<Configure> probed for the return type of malloc() and free() by
testing whether declarations for those functions produced a function
type mismatch with the implementation.  On Solaris, with a C++
compiler, this check always failed, since Solaris instead imports
malloc() and free() from C<std::> with C<using> for C++ builds.  Since
the return types of malloc() and free() are well defined by the C
standard, skip probing for them.  C<Configure> command-line arguments
and hints can still override these type in the unlikely case that is
needed.  [github #20806]

Redefining a C<use constant> list constant with C<use constant> now
properly warns.  This changes the behaviour of C<use constant> but is
a core change, not a change to F<constant.pm>.  [github #20742]

L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.
