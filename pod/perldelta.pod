Added brief documentation for some tools useful when developing perl
itself on Windows or Cygwin.

=head1 Diagnostics

The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output,
including warnings and fatal error messages.  For the complete list of
diagnostic messages, see L<perldiag>.

=head2 New Diagnostics

=head3 New Errors

=over 4

=item *

L<Cannot create an object of incomplete class "%s"|perldiag/"Cannot create an object of incomplete class "%s"">

(F) An attempt was made to create an object of a class where the start
of the class definition has been seen, but the class has not been
completed.

This can happen for a failed eval, or if you attempt to create an
object at compile time before the class is complete:

  eval "class Foo {"; Foo->new; # error
  class Bar { BEGIN { Bar->new } }; # error

Previously perl would assert or crash. [L<github #22159|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22159>]

=head1 Configuration and Compilation

=over 4

=item *

You can now separately enable high water mark checks for non-DEBUGGING
or disable them for DEBUGGING builds with C<-Accflags=-DPERL_USE_HWM>
or C<-Accflags=-DPERL_NO_HWM> respectively.  The default remains the
same.  [L<github #16607|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16607>]

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

prepare_export_lexical() was separately saving C<PL_comppad> and
C<PL_curpad>, this could result in C<PL_curpad> being restored to a no
longer valid value, resulting in a panic when importing lexicals in
some cases.  [L<github #21981|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21981>]

=item *

A string eval() operation in the scope of a C<use VERSION> declaration would
sometimes emit spurious "Changing use VERSION" warnings due to an
inconsistency in the way the version number was stored.  This is now fixed.

=head1 Known Problems

=over 4

=item *

fork() failures on cygwin with C<-DDEBUGGING> builds.

Perl uses the C<--enable-auto-image-base> option to set the base
images for DLLs for C<cygperl5_39_10.dll> and the DLLs needed for
dynamically loaded modules on cygwin.

With 5.39.10 if perl is built with C<-DDEBUGGING> or possibly other
options that increase the address space used by F<cygperl5_39_10.dll>,
the address space for F<cygperl5_39_10.dll> overlaps with the address
space allocated for F<mro.dll>.

The C<mro> module will still load, but if perl attempts to fork you
will likely see an error like:

 0 [main] perl 34054 child_info_fork::abort: address space needed by \
    'mro.dll' (0x400000) is already occupied

You can workaround this by building without the C<-DDEBUGGING> option,
or by making C<mro> a static extension:

  ./Configure ... -Astatic_ext=mro

We expect the name change of the F<cygperl5_39_10.dll> to
F<cygperl5_39_11.dll> in 5.39.11 will fix this problem for the next
release.  [L<github #22104|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22104>]

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  There may also be information at
L<https://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.
