=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.39.8

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.39.7 release and the 5.39.8
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.39.6, first read
L<perl5397delta>, which describes differences between 5.39.6 and 5.39.7.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 C<:reader> attribute for field variables

When using the C<class> feature, field variables can now take a C<:reader>
attribute.  This requests that an accessor method be automatically created
that simply returns the value of the field variable from the given instance.

    field $name :reader;

Is equivalent to

    field $name;
    method name () { return $name; }

An alternative name can also be provided:

    field $name :reader(get_name);

For more detail, see L<perlclass/:reader>.

=head2 Permit a space in C<-M> command-line option

When processing command-line options, perl now allows a space between the
C<-M> switch and the name of the module after it.

    $ perl -M Data::Dumper=Dumper -E 'say Dumper [1,2,3]'

This matches the existing behaviour of the C<-I> option.

=head2 Restrictions to C<use VERSION> declarations

In Perl 5.36, a deprecation warning was added when downgrading a
C<use VERSION> declaration from one above version 5.11, to below. This has
now been made a fatal error.

Additionally, it is now a fatal error to issue a subsequent C<use VERSION>
declaration when another is in scope, when either version is 5.39 or above.
This is to avoid complications surrounding imported lexical functions from
L<builtin>.  A deprecation warning has also been added for any other
subsequent C<use VERSION> declaration below version 5.39, to warn that it
will no longer be permitted in Perl version 5.46.

=head2 C<use VERSION> no longer removes imported C<builtin> functions

For a few development versions we have experimented with the idea that as
well as importing lexical functions, the C<use VERSION> syntax can also
remove previously imported functions when a new version is requested that
does not include them.  This behaviour of removing lexical functions has
turned out to be a bad model to follow so this version of Perl removes it
again.

As this behaviour has not appeared in any stable release of Perl, no warning
or deprecation period is required.

=head2 New C<builtin::inf> and C<builtin::nan> functions

Two new functions, C<inf> and C<nan>, have been added to the C<builtin>
namespace.  These act like constants that yield the floating-point infinity
and Not-a-Number value respectively.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Class barewords no longer resolved as file handles in method calls under C<no feature "bareword_filehandles">

Under C<no feature "bareword_filehandles"> bareword file handles
continued to be resolved in method calls:

    open FH, "<", $somefile or die;
    no feature 'bareword_filehandles';
    FH->binmode;

This has been fixed, so the:

    FH->binmode;

will attempt to resolve C<FH> as a class, typically resulting in a
runtime error.

The standard file handles such as C<STDOUT> continue to be resolved as
a handle:

    no feature 'bareword_filehandles';
    STDOUT->flush; # continues to work

Note that once perl resolves a bareword name as a class it will
continue to do so:

    package SomeClass {
        sub somemethod{}
    }
    open SomeClass, "<", "somefile" or die;
    # SomeClass resolved as a handle
    SomeClass->binmode;
    {
        no feature "bareword_filehandles";
        SomeClass->somemethod;
    }
    # SomeClass resolved as a class
    SomeClass->binmode;

[github #19426]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if not applicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<deprecated>-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>

following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

L<Use of uninitialized value%s|perldiag/"Use of uninitialized value%s">

This warning is now slightly more accurate in cases involving C<length>,
C<pop>, C<shift>, or C<splice>:

    my $x;
    length($x) == 0
    # Before:
    #  Use of uninitialized value $x in numeric eq (==) at ...
    # Now:
    #  Use of uninitialized value length($x) in numeric eq (==) at ...

That is, the warning no longer implies that C<$x> was used directly as an
operand of C<==>, which it wasn't.

Similarly:

    my @xs;
    shift @xs == 0
    # Before:
    #  Use of uninitialized value within @xs in numeric eq (==) at ...
    # Now:
    #  Use of uninitialized value shift(@xs) in numeric eq (==) at ...

This is more accurate because there never was an C<undef> within C<@xs> as the
warning implied. (The warning for C<pop> works analogously.)

Finally:

    my @xs = (1, 2, 3);
    splice(@xs, 0, 0) == 0
    # Before:
    #  Use of uninitialized value within @xs in numeric eq (==) at ...
    # Now:
    #  Use of uninitialized value in numeric eq (==) at ...

That is, in cases where C<splice> returns C<undef>, it no longer
unconditionally blames its first argument. This was misleading because
C<splice> can return C<undef> even if none of its arguments contain C<undef>.

=item *

Lexical subs now have a new stub in the pad for each recursive call
into the containing function.  This fixes two problems:

=over

=item *

If the lexical sub called the containing function, a "Can't undef
active subroutine" error would be thrown.  For example:

    use v5.36.0;
    sub outer($oc) {
        my sub inner ($c) {
             outer($c-1) if $c; # Can't undef active subroutine
        }
        inner($oc);
    }
    outer(2);

[github #18606]

=item *

If the lexical sub was called from a recursive call into the
containing function, this would overwrite the bindings to the closed
over variables in the lexical sub, so calls into the lexical sub from
the outer recursive call would have access to the variables from the
inner recursive call:

    use v5.36.0;
    sub outer ($x) {
        my sub inner ($label) {
            say "$label $x";
        }
        inner("first");
        outer("inner") if $x eq "outer";
        # this call to inner() sees the wrong $x
        inner("second");
    }
    outer("outer");
