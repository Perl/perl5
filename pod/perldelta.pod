=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.21.8

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.21.7 release and the 5.21.8
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.21.6, first read
L<perl5217delta>, which describes differences between 5.21.6 and 5.21.7.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 The warnings pragma now supports warnings outside of "all"

Ever since perl v5.6.0 we've had no way of adding new warnings without
retroactively adding them to all existing programs that used C<-w>,
C<-W> or C<use warnings>.

This caused us to not add new useful warnings out of fear that they
might unduly burden users who just wanted to upgrade perl and didn't
want to deal with a bunch of warnings from their existing code.

We now support a way to have our cake and eat it too, and can add new
warnings to the core going forward through other top-level warning
categories. See L<the warnings documentation|warnings/Top-level
warning categories & associated confusion> for details.

=head2 Non-Capturing Regular Expression Flag

Regular expressions now support a C</n> flag that disables capturing
and filling in C<$1>, C<$2>, etc... inside of groups:

  "hello" =~ /(hi|hello)/n; # $1 is not set

This is equivalent to putting C<?:> at the beginning of every capturing group.

See L<perlre/"n"> for more information.

=head2 C<prototype> with no arguments

C<prototype()> with no arguments now infers C<$_>.  [perl #123514]

=head2 C<use re 'strict'>

This applies stricter syntax rules to regular expression patterns
compiled within its scope, which hopefully will alert you to typos and
other unintentional behavior that backwards-compatibility issues prevent
us from doing in normal regular expression compilations.  Because the
behavior of this is subject to change in future Perl releases as we gain
experience, using this pragma will raise a category
C<experimental:re_strict> warning.
See L<'strict' in re|re/'strict' mode>.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 sub signatures moved before attributes

The experimental sub signatures feature, as introduced in 5.20, parsed
signatures after attributes.  In this release, the positioning has been
moved such that signatures occur in exactly the same positioning a
prototype would be found.

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

L<XXX> has been upgraded from version A.xx to B.yy.

=item *

L<attributes> has been upgraded from version 0.24 to 0.25.

Minor internal change only.

=item *

L<B> has been upgraded from version 1.54 to 1.55.

A bug where, after an ithread creation or psuedofork, special/immortal SVs in
the child ithread/psuedoprocess did not have the correct class of
C<B::SPECIAL>, has been fixed.

The C<id> and C<outid> PADLIST methods have been added.

=item *

L<B::Deparse> has been upgraded from version 1.31 to 1.32.

Deparsing C<BEGIN { undef &foo }> with the B<-w> switch enabled started to
emit 'uninitialized' warnings in Perl 5.14.  This has been fixed.

Deparsing calls to subs with a C<(;+)> prototype resulted in an infinite
loop.  The C<(;$>) C<(_)> and C<(;_)> prototypes were given the wrong
precedence, causing C<foo($a<$b)> to be deparsed without the parentheses.

=item *

L<File::Glob> has been upgraded from version 1.23 to 1.24.

Avoid SvIV() expanding to call get_sv() three times in a few
places. [perl #123606]

=item *

L<Module::Metadata> has been upgraded from version 1.000025 to 1.000026.

=item *

L<Safe> has been upgraded from version 2.38 to 2.39.

C<reval> was not propagating void context properly.

=item *

L<SDBM_File> has been upgraded from version 1.12 to 1.13.

Simplified the build process.  [perl #123413]

to actually have some effect.  This message will not be raised when
the underlying locale is hidden.

warnings have been silenced.  GCC all bitness and Visual C++ for Win32 were
not affected.

Added Perl_sv_get_backrefs() to determine if an SV is a weak-referent.

Function either returns an SV * of type AV, which contains the set of
weakreferences which reference the passed in SV, or a simple RV * which
is the only weakref to this item.

C<gv_add_by_type> which was added to public API in 5.11.0 but undocumented and
shows no CPAN usage has been removed from public API. Please use public API
C<GvSVn> C<GvIOn> C<GvAVn> and C<GvHVn> for adding elements to a GV.

=item *

C<GvSVn> C<GvIOn> C<GvAVn> and C<GvHVn> have been made rvalues, previously they
were lvalues. If you are assigning a SV to C<GvSVn> C<GvIOn> C<GvAVn> and
C<GvHVn> you are leaking memory. If you want an lvalue, use C<GvSV> C<GvIO>
C<GvAV> and C<GvHV>.

[ List each fix as a =item entry ]

=over 4

=item *

A bug in regular expression patterns that could lead to segfaults and
other crashes has been fixed.  This occurred only in patterns compiled
with C<"/i">, while taking into account the current POSIX locale (this usually
means they have to be compiled within the scope of C<S<"use locale">>),
and there must be a string of at least 128 consecutive bytes to match.
[perl #123539]

=item *

C<s///> now works on very long strings instead of dying with 'Substitution
loop'.  [perl #103260] [perl #123071]

=item *

C<gmtime> no longer crashes with not-a-number values.  [perl #123495]

=item *

C<\()> (reference to an empty list) and C<y///> with lexical $_ in scope
could do a bad write past the end of the stack.  They have been fixed
to extend the stack first.

=item *

C<prototype()> with no arguments used to read the previous item on the
stack, so C<print "foo", prototype()> would print foo's prototype.  It has
been fixed to infer $_ instead.  [perl #123514]

=item *

Some cases of lexical state subs inside predeclared subs could crash but no
longer do.

=item *

Some cases of nested lexical state subs inside anonymous subs could cause
'Bizarre copy' errors or possibly even crash.

=item *

When trying to emit warnings, perl's default debugger (F<perl5db.pl>) was
sometimes giving 'Undefined subroutine &DB::db_warn called' instead.  This
bug, which started to occur in Perl 5.18, has been fixed.  [perl #123553]

=item *

Certain syntax errors in substitutions, such as C<< s/${<>{})// >>, would
crash, and had done so since Perl 5.10.  (In some cases the crash did not
start happening till 5.16.)  The crash has, of course, been fixed.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
