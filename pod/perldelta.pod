=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file. Any text flagged as
XXX needs to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.15.8

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.15.7 release and
the 5.15.8 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.15.6, first read
L<perl5157delta>, which describes differences between 5.15.6 and
5.15.7.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here. Summarise user-visible core language
enhancements. Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Improved ability to mix locales and Unicode, including UTF-8 locales

An optional parameter has been added to C<use locale>

 use locale ':not_characters';

which tells Perl to use all but the C<LC_CTYPE> and C<LC_COLLATE>
portions of the current locale.  Instead, the character set is assumed
to be Unicode.  This allows locales and Unicode to be seamlessly mixed,
including the increasingly frequent UTF-8 locales.  When using this
hybrid form of locales, the C<:locale> layer to the L<open> pragma can
be used to interface with the file system, and there are CPAN modules
available for ARGV and environment variable conversions.

Full details are in L<perllocale>.

=head2 New function C<fc> and corresponding escape sequence C<\F> for Unicode foldcase

Unicode foldcase is an extension to lowercase that gives better results
when comparing two strings case-insensitively.  It has long been used
internally in regular expression C</i> matching.  Now it is available
explicitly through the new C<fc> function call (enabled by
S<C<"use feature 'fc'">>, or C<use v5.16>, or explicitly callable via
C<CORE::fc>) or through the new C<\F> sequence in double-quotish
strings.

Full details are in L<perlfunc/fc>.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Special blocks called in void context

Special blocks (C<BEGIN>, C<CHECK>, C<INIT>, C<UNITCHECK>, C<END>) are now
called in void context.  This avoids wasteful copying of the result of the
last statement [perl #108794].

=head2 The C<overloading> pragma and regexp objects

With C<no overloading>, regular expression objects returned by C<qr//> are
now stringified as "Regexp=REGEXP(0xbe600d)" instead of the regular
expression itself [perl #108780].

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.
In particular, deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are
listed as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

[ List each deprecation as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here. There
may well be none in a stable release.

[ List each enhancement as a =item entry ]

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>, which prints stub
entries to STDOUT.  Results can be pasted in place of the '=head2' entries
below.  A paragraph summary for important changes should then be added by hand.
In an ideal world, dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be
cribbed.

C<~~> now correctly handles the precedence of Any~~Object, and is not tricked
by an overloaded object on the left-hand side.

C<stat _> no longer warns about unopened filehandles [perl #71002].

=item *

C<stat> on an unopened filehandle now warns consistently, instead of
skipping the warning at times.

=item *

A change in an earlier 5.15 release caused warning hints to propagate into
C<do $file>.  This has been fixed [rt.cpan.org #72767].

=item *

Starting with 5.12.0, Perl used to get its internal bookkeeping muddled up
after assigning C<${ qr// }> to a hash element and locking it with
L<Hash::Util>.  This could result in double frees, crashes or erratic
behaviour.

=item *

In 5.15.7, some typeglobs in the CORE namespace were made read-only by
mistake.  This has been fixed [rt.cpan.org #74289].

C<-t> now works when stacked with other filetest operators [perl #77388].

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug>
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of C<perl -V>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes
all the core committers, who will be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently
distributed on CPAN.
