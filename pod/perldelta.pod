perldelta - what is new for perl v5.18.3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.18.2 release and the 5.18.3
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.18.1, first read
L<perl5182delta>, which describes differences between 5.18.1 and 5.18.2.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here.
There may well be none in a stable release.

[ List each enhancement as a =item entry ]

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>, which prints stub
entries to STDOUT.  Results can be pasted in place of the '=head2' entries
below.  A paragraph summary for important changes should then be added by hand.
In an ideal world, dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be
cribbed.

large changes to the testing harness (e.g. when parallel testing was added).
Changes to existing files in F<t/> aren't worth summarizing, although the bugs

Introduced by
L<perl #113536|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=113536>, a memory
leak on every call to C<system> and backticks (C< `` >), on most Win32 Perls
starting from 5.18.0 has been fixed.  The memory leak only occurred if you
enabled psuedo-fork in your build of Win32 Perl, and were running that build on
Server 2003 R2 or newer OS.  The leak does not appear on WinXP SP3.

The debugger now properly resets filehandles as needed. [perl #121456]

=item *

A segfault in Digest::SHA has been addressed.  [perl #121421]

=item *

perl can again be built with USE_64_BIT_INT, with Visual C 2003, 32 bit.
[perl #120925]

=item *

A leading { (brace) in formats is properly parsed again. [perl #119973]

tests that had to be C<TODO>ed for the release would be noted here.  Unfixed

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
