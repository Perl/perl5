=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file. Any text flagged as
XXX needs to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.13.7

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.13.6 release and
the 5.13.7 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.13.5, first read
L<perl5136delta>, which describes differences between 5.13.5 and
5.13.6.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here. Summarise user-visible core language
enhancements. Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Single term prototype

The C<+> prototype is a special alternative to C<$> that will act like
C<\[@%]> when given a literal array or hash variable, but will otherwise
force scalar context on the argument.  This is useful for functions which
should accept either a literal array or an array reference as the argument:

    sub smartpush (+@) {
        my $aref = shift;
        die "Not an array or arrayref" unless ref $aref eq 'ARRAY';
        push @$aref, @_;
    }

When using the C<+> prototype, your function must check that the argument
is of an acceptable type.

=head2 C<use re '/flags';>

The C<re> pragma now has the ability to turn on regular expression flags
till the end of the lexical scope:

    use re '/x';
    "foo" =~ / (.+) /;  # /x implied

See L<re/'/flags' mode> for details.

=head2 Statement labels can appear in more places

Statement labels can now occur before any type of statement or declaration,
such as C<package>.

=head2 C<use feature "unicode_strings"> now applies to more regex matching

Another chunk of the L<perlunicode/The "Unicode Bug"> is fixed in this
release.  Now, regular expressions compiled within the scope of the
"unicode_strings" feature (or under the "u" regex modifier (specifiable
currently only with infix notation C<(?u:...)> or via C<use re '/u'>)
will match the same whether or not the target string is encoded in utf8,
with regard to C<[[:posix:]]> character classes

Work is underway to add the case sensitive matching to the control of
this feature, but was not complete in time for this dot release.

=head2 Array and hash container functions accept references

All built-in functions that operate directly on array or hash
containers now also accept hard references to arrays or hashes:

  |----------------------------+---------------------------|
  | Traditional syntax         | Terse syntax              |
  |----------------------------+---------------------------|
  | push @$arrayref, @stuff    | push $arrayref, @stuff    |
  | unshift @$arrayref, @stuff | unshift $arrayref, @stuff |
  | pop @$arrayref             | pop $arrayref             |
  | shift @$arrayref           | shift $arrayref           |
  | splice @$arrayref, 0, 2    | splice $arrayref, 0, 2    |
  | keys %$hashref             | keys $hashref             |
  | keys @$arrayref            | keys $arrayref            |
  | values %$hashref           | values $hashref           |
  | values @$arrayref          | values $arrayref          |
  | ($k,$v) = each %$hashref   | ($k,$v) = each $hashref   |
  | ($k,$v) = each @$arrayref  | ($k,$v) = each $arrayref  |
  |----------------------------+---------------------------|

This allows these built-in functions to act on long dereferencing chains
or on the return value of subroutines without needing to wrap them in
C<@{}> or C<%{}>:

  push @{$obj->tags}, $new_tag;  # old way
  push $obj->tags,    $new_tag;  # new way

  for ( keys %{$hoh->{genres}{artists}} ) {...} # old way 
  for ( keys $hoh->{genres}{artists}    ) {...} # new way 

For C<push>, C<unshift> and C<splice>, the reference will auto-vivify
if it is not defined, just as if it were wrapped with C<@{}>.

Calling C<keys> or C<values> directly on a reference gives a substantial
performance improvement over explicit dereferencing.

For C<keys>, C<values>, C<each>, when overloaded dereferencing is
present, the overloaded dereference is used instead of dereferencing the
underlying reftype.  Warnings are issued about assumptions made in the
following three ambiguous cases:

  (a) If both %{} and @{} overloading exists, %{} is used
  (b) If %{} overloading exists on a blessed arrayref, %{} is used
  (c) If @{} overloading exists on a blessed hashref, @{} is used

=head2 y///r

The C</r> flag, which was added to C<s///> in 5.13.2, has been extended to
the C<y///> operator.

It causes it to perform the substitution on a I<copy> of its operand,
returning that copy instead of a character count.

=head2 New global variable C<${^GLOBAL_PHASE}>

A new global variable, C<${^GLOBAL_PHASE}>, has been added to allow
introspection of the current phase of the perl interpreter. It's explained in
detail in L<perlvar/"${^GLOBAL_PHASE}"> and
L<perlmod/"BEGIN, UNITCHECK, CHECK, INIT and END">.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX. If any
    exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Dereferencing typeglobs

If you assign a typeglob to a scalar variable:

    $glob = *foo;

the glob that is copied to C<$glob> is marked with a special flag
indicating that the glob is just a copy. This allows subsequent assignments
to C<$glob> to overwrite the glob. The original glob, however, is
immutable.

Many Perl operators did not distinguish between these two types of globs.
This would result in strange behaviour in edge cases: C<untie $scalar>
would do nothing if the last thing assigned to the scalar was a glob
(because it treated it as C<untie *$scalar>, which unties a handle).
Assignment to a glob slot (e.g., C<(*$glob) = \@some_array>) would simply
assign C<\@some_array> to C<$glob>.

To fix this, the C<*{}> operator (including the C<*foo> and C<*$foo> forms)
has been modified to make a new immutable glob if its operand is a glob
copy. Various operators that make a distinction between globs and scalars
have been modified to treat only immutable globs as globs.

This causes an incompatible change in code that assigns a glob to the
return value of C<*{}> when that operator was passed a glob copy. Take the
following code, for instance:

    $glob = *foo;
    *$glob = *bar;

The C<*$glob> on the second line returns a new immutable glob. That new
glob is made an alias to C<*bar>. Then it is discarded. So the second
assignment has no effect.

The upside to this incompatible change is that bugs

and maybe others, too, have been fixed.

See L<http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=77810> for even
more detail.

=head2 Clearing stashes

Stash list assignment C<%foo:: = ()> used to make the stash anonymous
temporarily while it was being emptied. Consequently, any of its
subroutines referenced elsewhere would become anonymous (showing up as
"(unknown)" in C<caller>). Now they retain their package names, such that
C<caller> will return the original sub name if there is still a reference
to its typeglob, or "foo::__ANON__" otherwise

Concatenating long strings under C<use encoding> no longer causes perl to
crash
L<[perl #78674]|http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=78674>.

=item *

Typeglob assignments would crash if the glob's stash no longer existed, so
long as the glob assigned to was named 'ISA' or the glob on either side of
the assignment contained a subroutine.

=item *

Calling C<< ->import >> on a class lacking an import method could corrupt the stack result in strange behaviour. For instance,

  push @a, "foo", $b = bar->import;

would assign 'foo' to C<$b>
L<[perl #63790]|http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=63790>.

=item *

Creating an alias to a package when that package had been detached from the
symbol table would result in corrupted isa caches
L<[perl #77358]|http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=77358>.

=item *

C<.=> followed by C<< <> >> or C<readline> would leak memory if C<$/>
contained characters beyond the octet range and the scalar assigned to
happened to be encoded as UTF8 internally
L<[perl #72246]|http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=72246>.

=item *

The C<recv> function could crash when called with the MSG_TRUNC flag
L<[perl #75082]|http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=75082>.

=item *

Evaluating a simple glob (like C<*a>) was calling get-magic on the glob,
even when its contents were not being used
L<[perl #78580]|http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=78580>.

This bug was introduced in 5.13.2 and did not affect earlier perl versions.

=item *

Matching a Unicode character against an alternation containing characters
that happened to match continuation bytes in the former's UTF8
representation (C<qq{\x{30ab}} =~ /\xab|\xa9/>) would cause erroneous
warnings
L<[perl #70998]|http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=70998>.

=item *

C<s///r> (added in 5.13.2) no longer leaks.

=item *

The trie optimisation was not taking empty groups into account, preventing
'foo' from matching C</\A(?:(?:)foo|bar|zot)\z/>
L<[perl #78356]|http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=78356>.

=item *

A pattern containing a C<+> inside a lookahead would sometimes cause an
incorrect match failure in a global match (e.g., C</(?=(\S+))/g>)
L<[perl #68564]|http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=68564>.

=item *

Iterating with C<foreach> over an array returned by an lvalue sub now works
L<[perl #23790]|http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=23790>.

=item *

C<$@> is now localised during calls to C<binmode> to prevent action at a
distance
L<[perl #78844]|http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=78844>.

=item *

C<PL_isarev>, which is accessible to Perl via C<mro::get_isarev> is now
updated properly when packages are deleted or removed from the C<@ISA> of
other classes. This allows many packages to be created and deleted without
causing a memory leak
L<[perl #75176]|http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=75176>.

=item *

C<undef *Foo::> and C<undef *Foo::ISA> and C<delete $package::{ISA}>
used not to update the internal isa caches if the
stash or C<@ISA> array had a reference elsewhere. In
fact, C<undef *Foo::ISA> would stop a new C<@Foo::ISA> array from updating
caches.

=item *

C<@ISA> arrays can now be shared between classes via
C<*Foo::ISA = \@Bar::ISA> or C<*Foo::ISA = *Bar::ISA>
L<[perl #77238]|http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=77238>.

=item *

The parser no longer hangs when encountering certain Unicode characters,
such as U+387
L<[perl #74022]|http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=74022>.

=item *

C<formline> no longer crashes when passed a tainted format picture. It also
taints C<$^A> now if its arguments are tainted
L<[perl #79138]|http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=79138>.

=item *

A signal handler called within a signal handler could cause leaks or
double-frees. Now fixed.
L<[perl #76248]|http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=76248>.

=head1 Known Problems

XXX Descriptions of platform agnostic bugs we know we can't fix go here. Any
tests that had to be C<TODO>ed for the release would be noted here, unless
they were specific to a particular platform (see below).

This is a list of some significant unfixed bugs, which are regressions
from either 5.XXX.XXX or 5.XXX.XXX.

=head1 Obituary

XXX If any significant core contributor has died, we've added a short obituary
here.

Randy Kobes, creator of the kobesearch alternative to search.cpan.org and
contributor/maintainer to several core Perl toolchain modules, passed away
on September 18, 2010 after a battle with lung cancer.  His contributions
to the Perl community will be missed.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the B<perlbug>
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of C<perl -V>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently
distributed on CPAN.
