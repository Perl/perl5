to L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.

Additionally, the following selected changes have been made:

=head3 L<perlapi>

=over 4

=item *

C<sv_2pvbyte> updated to mention it will croak if the SV cannot be
downgraded.

updated and clarified.

=back

=head3 L<perlguts>

=over 4

=item *

Don't suggest using perl's C<malloc> anymore. Modern system C<malloc> is
assumed to be much better than perl's implementation at this point.

=back

=head3 L<perlintro>

=over 4

=item *

The docs for the repetition operator C<x> have been clarified

[L<GH #17335|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17335>]

=over 4

=item *

The documentation surrounding C<open> and handle usage has been modernized
to prefer 3-arg open and lexical variables instead of barewords.

replacing C<-w> with C<use warnings>.

=back

=head3 L<perlport>

=over 4

[L<GH #16431|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16431>]

=back

=head3 L<perlvar>

Recommend stringifying C<$]> and comparing it numerically.

C<setlocale> warning about threaded builds updated to note it does not
apply on Perl 5.28.X and later.

=item *

the supplied signals cannot be added to the set.

=back

=head1 Diagnostics

The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output,
including warnings and fatal error messages.  For the complete list of
diagnostic messages, see L<perldiag>.

=head2 Changes to Existing Diagnostics

=over 4

=item *

The "Code point 0x%X is not Unicode, and not portable" warning removed
the line "Code points above 0xFFFF_FFFF require larger than a 32 bit word."
as code points that large are no longer legal on 32-bit platforms.

=back

=head1 Configuration and Compilation

=over 4

=item *

For clang++, add C<< #include <stdlib.h> >> to Configure's probes for
C<futimes>, C<strtoll>, C<strtoul>, C<strtoull>, C<strtouq>, otherwise the
probes would fail to compile.

=item *

Use a compile and run test for C<lchown> to satisfy clang++ which should
more reliably detect it.

=item *

For C++ compilers, add C<< #include <stdio.h> >> to Configure's probes for
C<getpgrp> and C<setpgrp> as they use printf and C++ compilers may fail
compilation instead of just warning.

=back

=head1 Testing

Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and
changes in this release.  Furthermore, these significant changes were
made:

Perl to once again compile on certain configurations of Solaris.

=back

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

C<savepvn>'s len parameter is now a C<Size_t> instead of an C<I32> since we

=head1 Acknowledgements

Perl 5.31.8 represents approximately 4 weeks of development since Perl
5.31.7 and contains approximately 16,000 lines of changes across 400 files
from 25 authors.

Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were
approximately 8,300 lines of changes to 260 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant
community of users and developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.31.8:

Andy Dougherty, Bernhard M. Wiedemann, Chad Granum, Chase Whitener, Chris
'BinGOs' Williams, Craig A. Berry, Dan Book, Dan Kogai, David Mitchell,

the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case.

inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.
