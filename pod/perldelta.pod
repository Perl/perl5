=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.8.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.8.0 release and
the 5.8.1 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release like 5.6.1, read first
the L<perl58delta>, which describes differences between 5.6.0 and
5.8.0.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 Hash Randomisation

Mainly due to security reasons, the "random ordering" of hashes
has been made even more random.  Previously while the order of hash
elements from keys(), values(), and each() was essentially random,
it was still repeatable.  Now, however, the order varies between
different runs of Perl.

B<Perl has never guaranteed any ordering of the hash keys>, and the
ordering has already changed several times during the lifetime of
Perl 5.  Also, the ordering of hash keys has always been, and
continues to be, affected by the insertion order.

The added randomness may affect applications.

One possible scenario is when output of an application has included
hash data.  For example, if you have used the Data::Dumper module to
dump data into different files, and then compared the files to see
whether the data has changed, now you will have false positives since
the order in which hashes are dumped will vary.  In general the cure
is to sort the keys (or the values); in particular for Data::Dumper to
use the C<Sortkeys> option; or if some particular order is really
important, use tied hashes.

More subtle problem is reliance on the order of "global destruction".
That is what happens at the end of execution: Perl destroys all data
structures, including user data.  If your destructors (the DESTROY
subroutines) have assumed any particular ordering to the global
destruction, there might be problems ahead.  For example, in a
destructor of one object you cannot assume that objects of any other
class are still available, unless you hold a reference to them.
If the environment variable PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL is set to a non-zero
value, or if Perl is exiting a spawned thread, it will also destruct
the ordinary references and the symbol tables that are no longer in use.
You can't call a class method or an ordinary function on a class that
has been collected that way.

The hash randomisation is certain to reveal hidden assumptions about
some particular ordering of hash elements, and outright bugs: it
revealed a few bugs in the Perl core and core modules.

To disable the hash randomisation in runtime, set the environment
variable PERL_HASH_SEED to 0 (zero) before running Perl (for more
information see L<perlrun/PERL_HASH_SEED>), or to disable the feature
completely in compile time, compile with C<-DNO_HASH_SEED> (see F<INSTALL>).

See L<perlsec/"Algorithmic Complexity Attacks"> for the original
rationale behind this change.

=head2 UTF-8 On Filehandles No More Activated By Locale

In Perl 5.8.0 all filehandles, including the standard filehandles,
were implicitly set to be in Unicode UTF-8 if the locale settings
indicated the use of UTF-8.  This feature caused too many problems,
so the feature was turned off and redesigned: see L</"Core Enhancements">.

=head2 (FreeBSD) Perl now uses the Perl malloc

Using FreeBSD's system malloc for Perl was found to be very slow:
in some applications that was 200 times slower than using the Perl
malloc.  Therefore Perl now uses by default its own malloc, though
one can still force the system malloc with Configure C<-Uusemymalloc>.

=head2 (Win32) The -C Switch Has Been Repurposed

The -C switch has changed in an incompatible way.  The old semantics
of this switch only made sense in Win32 and only in the "use utf8"
universe in 5.6.x releases, and do not make sense for the Unicode
implementation in 5.8.0.  Since this switch could not have been used
by anyone, it has been repurposed.  The behavior that this switch
enabled in 5.6.x releases may be supported in a transparent,
data-dependent fashion in a future release.

For the new life of this switch, see L<"UTF-8 no longer default under
UTF-8 locales">, and L<perlrun/-C>.

=head2 (Win32) The /d Switch Of cmd.exe

Perl 5.8.1 uses the /d switch when running the cmd.exe shell
internally for system(), backticks, and when opening pipes to external
programs.  The extra switch disables the execution of AutoRun commands
from the registry, which is generally considered undesirable when
running external programs.  If you wish to retain compatibility with
the older behavior, set PERL5SHELL in your environment to C<cmd /x/c>.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 UTF-8 no longer default under UTF-8 locales

In Perl 5.8.0 many Unicode features were introduced.   One of them
was found to be of more nuisance than benefit: the automagic
(and silent) "UTF-8-ification" of filehandles, including the
standard filehandles, if the user's locale settings indicated
use of UTF-8.

For example, if you had C<en_US.UTF-8> as your locale, your STDIN and
STDOUT were automatically "UTF-8", in other words an implicit
binmode(..., ":utf8") was made.  This meant that trying to print, say,
chr(0xff), ended up printing the bytes 0xc3 0xbf.  Hardly what you had
in mind unless you were aware of this feature of Perl 5.8.0.  The problem
is that the vast majority of people weren't: for example in RedHat releases
8 and 9 the B<default> locale setting is UTF-8, so all RedHat users got
UTF-8 filehandles, whether they wanted it or not.  The pain was
intensified by the Unicode implementation of Perl 5.8.0 (still) having nasty
bugs, especially related to the use of s/// and tr///.
(Bugs that have been fixed in 5.8.1)

Therefore a decision was made to backtrack the feature and change it
from implicit silent default to explicit conscious option.  The new
Perl command line option C<-C> and its counterpart environment
variable PERL_UNICODE can now be used to control how Perl and Unicode
interact at interfaces like I/O and for example the command line
arguments.  See L<perlrun> for more information.

=head2 Unsafe signals again available

In Perl 5.8.0 the so-called "safe signals" were introduced.  This
means that Perl no longer handles signals immediately but instead
"between opcodes", when it is safe to do so.  The earlier immediate
handling easily could corrupt the internal state of Perl, resulting
in mysterious crashes.

However, the new safer model has its problems too.  Because now an
opcode, a basic unit of Perl execution, is never interrupted but
instead let to run to completion, certain operations that can take a
long time now really do take a long time.  For example, certain
network operations have their own blocking and timeout mechanisms, and
being able to interrupt them immediately would be nice.

Therefore perl 5.8.1 introduces a "backdoor" to restore the pre-5.8.0
(5.7.3, really) signal behaviour.  Just set the environment variable
PERL_SIGNALS to C<unsafe>, and the old immediate (and unsafe)
signal handling behaviour returns.

=head2 Tied Arrays with Negative Array Indices

Formerly, the indices passed to C<FETCH>, C<STORE>, C<EXISTS>, and
C<DELETE> methods in tied array class were always non-negative.  If
the actual argument was negative, Perl would call FETCHSIZE implicitly
and add the result to the index before passing the result to the tied
array method.  This behaviour is now optional.  If the tied array class
contains a package variable named C<$NEGATIVE_INDICES> which is set to
a true value, negative values will be passed to C<FETCH>, C<STORE>,
C<EXISTS>, and C<DELETE> unchanged.

=head2 local ${$x}

The syntaxes

	local ${$x}
	local @{$x}
	local %{$x}

now do localise variables, given that the $x is a valid variable name.

=head2 Unicode Character Database 4.0.0

Unicode Character Database has been updated to 4.0.0 from 3.2.0.

=head2 Warnings

Perl 5.8.0 forgot to add some deprecation warnings.  These warnings
have now been added.

=head2 Pseudo-hashes really are deprecated

Pseudo-hashes were deprecated in Perl 5.8.0 and will be removed in Perl
5.10.0, see L<perl58delta> for details.  Each attempt to access pseudo-hashes
will trigger the warning C<Pseudo-hashes are deprecated>.  If you really want
to continue using pseudo-hashes but not to see the deprecation warnings, add:

    no warnings 'deprecated';

Or you can continue to use the L<fields> pragma, but please don't
expect the data structures to be pseudohashes any more.

=head2 5.005-style threads really are deprecated

5.005-style threads (activated by C<use Thread;>) were deprecated in Perl
5.8.0 and will be removed in Perl 5.10.0, see L<perl58delta> for details.
Each attempt to create a 5.005-style thread will trigger the warning
C<5.005 threads are deprecated>.  If you really want to continue using
5.005 threads but not to see the deprecation warnings, add:

    no warnings 'deprecated';

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

=head2 Updated Modules

B::Concise

B::Deparse

Benchmark - An optional feature, C<:hireswallclock>, now allows
for high resolution wall clock times (uses Time::HiRes).

CGI

charnames - One can now have custom character name aliases.

CPAN - There is now a simple command line frontend to the CPAN.pm
module called F<cpan>.

Data::Dumper - A new option, Pair, allows choosing the separator
between hash keys and values.

DB_File

Digest::MD5

Encode - significant updates on the encoding pragma functionality
(tr/// and DATA, formats)

libnet

Math::BigInt

MIME::Base64

Net::Ping

podlators

Pod::LaTeX

PodParsers

Pod::Perldoc

Scalar::Util - New utilities: refaddr, isvstring, looks_like_number,
set_prototype.

Storable - can now store code references (via B::Deparse, so not
foolproof).

Term::ANSIcolor

Test::Harness - now much more picky about extra or missing output
from test scripts.

Test::More

Test::Simple

Text::Balanced

Time::HiRes - Use of nanosleep(), if available, allows mixing
subsecond sleeps with alarms.

threads - Several fixes, for example for join() problems and memory
leaks.  In some platforms (like Linux) that use glibc the memory
footprint of one ithread has been reduced by several hundred kilobytes.

threads::shared - Many memory leaks have been fixed.

Unicode::Collate

Unicode::Normalize

Win32::GetFolderPath

=head1 Utility Changes

The Perl debugger (F<lib/perl5db.pl>) has now been extensively
documented and bugs found while documented have been fixed.

perldoc has been rewritten from scratch to be more robust and
featureful.

=head1 New Documentation

perl573delta has been added to list the differences between the
(now quite obsolete) development releases 5.7.2 and 5.7.3.

perl58delta has been added: it is the perldelta of 5.8.0, detailing
the differences between 5.6.0 and 5.8.0.

perlartistic has been added: it is the Artistic License in pod format,
making it easier for modules to refer to it.

perlgpl has been added: it is the GNU General Public License in pod
format, making it easier for modules to refer to it.

perlos400 has been added to tell about the installation and use
of Perl in OS/400 PASE.

=head1 Installation and Configuration Improvements

The UNIX standard Perl location, F</usr/bin/perl>, is no longer
overwritten by default if it exists.  This change was very prudent
because so many UNIX vendors already provide a F</usr/bin/perl>,
but simultaneously many system utilities may depend on that
exact version of Perl, so better not to overwrite it.

One can now specify installation directories for site and vendor man
and HTML pages, and site and vendor scripts.  See F<INSTALL.>

gcc versions 3.x introduced a new warning that caused a lot of noise
during Perl compilation: C<gcc -Ialreadyknowndirectory (warning:
changing search order)>.  This warning has now been avoided by
Configure weeding out such directories before the compilation.

One can now build subsets of Perl core modules by using the
Configure flags C<-Dnoextensions=> and C<-Donlyextensions=>,
see F<INSTALL>

The Perl malloc has been enhanced: for example in FreeBSD Perl
now builds with that by default, operation on 64-bit platforms
should now also be better, and there are more debugging options
and features.

Mac OS X now installs with Perl version number embedded in
installation directory names for easier upgrading of user-compiled
Perl.  (In other words, the default installation no more breaks the
Apple-provided Perl.)

In newer FreeBSD releases Perl 5.8.0 compilation failed because of
trying to use <malloc.h>, which in FreeBSD is just a dummy file, and
a fatal error to even try to use.  Now <malloc.h> is not used.

Tru64 gcc 3.2.1 -O3 toke.c dropped to -O2 because of gigantic
memory use otherwise.

Tru64 can now build Perl with the newer Berkeley DBs.

Perl has been ported to IBM's OS/400 PASE environment.  The best way
to build a Perl for PASE is to use an AIX host as a cross-compilation
environment.  See README.os400.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=head2 Closures, eval and lexicals

There have been many fixes in the area of anonymous subs, lexicals and
closures. Although this means that Perl is now more "correct", it is
possible that some existing code will break that happens to rely on
the faulty behaviour.  In practice this is unlikely unless your code
contains a very complex nesting of anonymous subs, evals and lexicals.

=head2 Generic fixes

binmode(SOCKET, ":utf8") only worked on the input side, not
on the output side of the socket.  Now it works both ways.

For threaded Perls certain system database functions like getpwent()
and getgrent() now grow their result buffer dynamically, instead of
failing.  This means that at sites with lots of users and groups the
functions no more fail by returning only partial results.

Perl 5.8.0 had accidentally broken the capability for users
to define their own uppercase<->lowercase Unicode mappings
(as advertised by the Camel).  This feature has been fixed and
is also documented better.

In 5.8.0 this

	$some_unicode .= <FH>;

didn't work correctly but instead corrupted the data.  This has now
been fixed.

FETCH etc may now safely access tied values (ie resulting in a recursive
call to FETCH etc).

Linenumbers in Perl scripts may now be greater than 65536, or 2**16.
(Perl scripts have always been able to be larger than that, it's just
that the linenumber for reported errors and warnings have "wrapped
around".)  While scripts that large usually indicate a need to rethink
your code a bit, such Perl scripts do exist, for example as results
from generated code.  Now linenumbers can go all the way to
4294967296, or 2**32.

=head2 Module-specific fixes

Encode: if a filehandle has been marked as to have an encoding,
unmappable characters are detected already during input, not later
(when the corrupted data is being used).

PerlIO::scalar; reading from non-string scalars (like the special
variables, see L<perlvar>) now works.

=head2 Platform-specific fixes

Linux

=over 4

=item *

Setting $0 works again (with certain limitations that
Perl cannot do much about: see L<perlvar/$0>)

=back

HP-UX

=over 4

=item *

Setting $0 now works.

=back

VMS

=over 4

=item *

IO::Poll now works.

=back

Win32

=over 4

=item *

A memory leak in the fork() emulation has been fixed.

=item *

The return value of the ioctl() built-in function was accidentally
broken in 5.8.0.  This has been corrected.

=item *

The internal message loop executed by perl during blocking operations
sometimes interfered with messages that were external to Perl.
This often resulted in blocking operations terminating prematurely or
returning incorrect results, when Perl was executing under environments
that could generate Windows messages.  This has been corrected.

=item *

Pipes and sockets are now automatically in binary mode.

=item *

The four-argument form of select() did not preserve $! (errno) properly
when there were errors in the underlying call.  This is now fixed.

=back

=head1 New or Changed Diagnostics

All the warnings related to pack() and unpack() were made more
informative and consistent.

=head2 Changed "A thread exited while %d threads were running"

The old version

    A thread exited while %d other threads were still running

was misleading because the "other" included also the thread giving
the warning.

=head2 Removed "Attempt to clear a restricted hash"

It is not illegal to clear a restricted hash, so the warning
was removed.

=head2 New "Can't provide tied hash usage; use keys(%hash) to test if empty"

Use of C<%hash> in scalar context (like for example as the test of C<if>)
is not available for tied hashes.  Currently any tied hash, elements or not,
returns a true value in scalar context.  This is probably not what you
had in mind, so Perl aborts.

=head2 New "Illegal declaration of anonymous subroutine"

You must specify the block of code for C<sub>.

=head2 Changed "Invalid range "%s" in transliteration operator"

The old version

    Invalid [] range "%s" in transliteration operator

was simply wrong because there are no "[] ranges" in tr///.

=head2 New "Missing control char name in \c"

Self-explanatory.

=head2 New "Newline in left-justified string for %s"

The padding spaces would appear after the newline, which is
probably not what you had in mind.

=head2 New "Possible precedence problem on bitwise %c operator"

If you think this

    $x & $y == 0

tests whether the bitwise AND of $x and $y is zero,
you will like this warning.

=head2 New "Pseudo-hashes are deprecated"

This warning should have been already in 5.8.0, since they are.

=head2 New "read() on %s filehandle %s"

You cannot read() (or sysread()) from a closed or unopened filehandle.

=head2 New "5.005 threads are deprecated"

This warning should have been already in 5.8.0, since they are.

=head2 New "Tied variable freed while still in use"

Something pulled the plug on a live free variable, Perl plays
safe by bailing out.

=head2 New "To%s: illegal mapping '%s'"

An illegal user-defined Unicode casemapping was specified.

=head2 New "Use of freed value in iteration (perhaps you modified the iterated array within the loop?)"

Something modified the values being iterated over.  This is not good.

=head1 Changed Internals

These news matter to you only if you either write XS code or like to
hack Perl internals, or like to run Perl with the C<-D> option.

The embedding examples of L<perlembed> have been reviewed to be
uptodate and consistent: for example, the correct use of
PERL_SYS_INIT3() and PERL_SYS_TERM().

Extensive reworking of the pad code has been conducted by Dave Mitchell.

Extensive work on the v-strings by John Peacock.

UTF-8 length and position cache: to speed up the handling of Unicode
(UTF-8) scalars, a cache was introduced.  Potential problems if an
extension bypasses the official APIs and directly modifies the PV
of an SV: the UTF-8 cache does not get cleared as it should.

APIs obsoleted in Perl 5.8.0s like sv_2pv, sv_catpvn, sv_catsv,
sv_setsv, are again available.

Certain Perl core C APIs like cxinc and regatom are no more available.
They never should have been, and if you application depends on them,
you should (be ashamed and) contact perl5-porters to discuss what are
the proper APIs.

Certain APIs like Perl_list are no longer available without their
Perl_ prefix.  If your XS module stops working because some functions
cannot be found, in many cases a simple fix is to add the C<Perl_>
prefix to the function and the thread context C<aTHX_> as the first
argument of the function call. For cleaner embedding you can also
force this for all APIs by defining at compile time the cpp define
PERL_NO_SHORT_NAMES.

Perl_save_bool() has been added.

utf8::is_utf8() has been added as a quick way to test whether
a scalar is encoded internally in UTF-8 (Unicode).

C<-DL> removed (the leaktest had been broken and unsupported for years,
use alternative debugging mallocs or tools like valgrind and Purify).

Verbose modifier C<v> added for C<-DXv> and C<-Dsv>, see L<perlrun>.

=head1 New Tests

In Perl 5.8.0 there were about 69000 separate tests in about 700 test files,
in Perl 5.8.1 there are about 75000 separate tests in about 750 test files.
The exact numbers depend on the Perl configuration and on the operating
system platform.

=head1 Known Problems

The hash randomisation mentioned in L</Incompatible Changes> is definitely
problematic: it will wake dormant bugs and shake out bad assumptions.

Many of the rarer platforms that worked 100% or pretty close to it
with perl 5.8.0 have been left a little bit untended since their
maintainers have been otherwise busy lately, and therefore there will
be more failures on those platforms.  Such platforms include Mac OS
Classic, IBM z/OS (and other EBCDIC platforms), and NetWare.  The most
common Perl platforms (Unix and Unix-like, Microsoft platforms, and
VMS) have large enough testing and expert population that they are
doing well.

=head1 Platform Specific Problems

=head2 Win32 sysopen, sysread, syswrite

As of the 5.8.0 release, sysopen()/sysread()/syswrite() do not behave
like they used to in 5.6.1 and earlier with respect to "text" mode.
These built-ins now always operate in "binary" mode (even if sysopen()
was passed the O_TEXT flag, or if binmode() was used on the file
handle).  Note that this issue should only make a difference for disk
files, as sockets and pipes have always been in "binary" mode in the
Windows port.  As this behavior is currently considered a bug,
compatible behavior may be re-introduced in a future release.  Until
then, the use of sysopen(), sysread() and syswrite() is not supported
for "text" mode operations.

=head2 EBCDIC Platforms

IBM z/OS and other EBCDIC platforms continue to be problematic
regarding Unicode support.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://bugs.perl.org/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.com/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the B<perlbug>
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of C<perl -V>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.  You can browse and search
the Perl 5 bugs at http://bugs.perl.org/
