=head1 NAME

perl5356delta - what is new for perl v5.35.6

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.35.5 release and the 5.35.6
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.35.4, first read
L<perl5355delta>, which describes differences between 5.35.4 and 5.35.5.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 C<use v5.36> now disables bareword_filehandles, indirect, and multidimensional

The C<:5.36> bundle, loaded by C<use v5.36>, no longer includes
C<bareword_filehandles>, C<indirect>, or C<multidimensional> meaning that these
discouraged forms of syntax will not be allowed within the scope of that
version declaration.

This will also affect C<use v5.35.x>, even on subversions of v5.35 prior to
this one.

=head1 Obituary

David H. Adler (DHA) passed away on November 16, 2021.  In 1997, David
co-founded NY.pm, the first Perl user group, and in 1998 co-founded Perl
Mongers to help establish other user groups across the globe.  He was a
frequent attendee at Perl conferences in both North America and Europe and
well known for his role in organizing I<Bad Movie Night> celebrations at those
conferences.  He also contributed to the work of the Perl Foundation,
including administering the White Camel awards for community service.  He will
be sorely missed.

=head1 Acknowledgements

Perl 5.35.6 represents approximately 4 weeks of development since Perl
5.35.5 and contains approximately 16,000 lines of changes across 320 files
from 10 authors.

Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were
approximately 13,000 lines of changes to 240 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant
community of users and developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.35.6:

Dagfinn Ilmari Manns√•ker, H.Merijn Brand, James E Keenan, Leon Timmermans,
Pete Houston, Ricardo Signes, Richard Leach, Robert Rothenberg, Sergey
Poznyakoff, Tony Cook.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

see the F<AUTHORS> file in the Perl source distribution.

tiny but sufficient test case.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
