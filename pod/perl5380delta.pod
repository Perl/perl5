=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.38.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.36.0 release and the 5.38.0
release.

=head1 Notice

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Unicode 15.0 is supported

See L<https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/> for details.

=head2 PERL_RAND_SEED

Added a new environment variable C<PERL_RAND_SEED> which can be used to
cause a perl program which uses C<rand> without using C<srand()>
explicitly or which uses C<srand()> with no arguments to be repeatable.
See L<perlrun>. This feature can be disabled at compile time by passing

    -Accflags=-DNO_PERL_RAND_SEED

to F<Configure> during the build process.

=head2 Defined-or and logical-or assignment default expressions to signatures

The default expression for a subroutine signature parameter can now be
assigned using the C<//=> or C<||=> operators, to apply the defaults whenever
the caller provided an undefined or false value (respectively), rather than
simply when the parameter is missing entirely.  For more detail see the
documentation in L<perlsub>.

=head2 @INC Hook Enhancements and $INC and INCDIR

The internals for C<@INC> hooks have been hardened to handle various
edge cases and should no longer segfault or throw assert failures when
hooks modify C<@INC> during a require operation.  As part of this we
now ensure that any given hook is executed at most once during a require
call, and that any duplicate directories do not trigger additional
directory probes.

To provide developers more control over dynamic module lookup, a new hook
method C<INCDIR> is now supported. An object supporting this method may be
injected into the C<@INC> array, and when it is encountered in the module
search process it will be executed, just like how INC hooks are executed,
and its return value used as a list of directories to search for the
module. Returning an empty list acts as a no-op. Note that since any
references returned by this hook will be stringified and used as strings,
you may not return a hook to be executed later via this API.

When an C<@INC> hook (either C<INC> or C<INCDIR>) is called during
require, the C<$INC> variable will be localized to be the value of the
index of C<@INC> that the hook came from. If the hook wishes to override
what the "next" index in C<@INC> should be it may update C<$INC> to be one
less than the desired index (C<undef> is equivalent to C<-1>). This
allows an C<@INC> hook to completely rewrite the C<@INC> array and have
perl restart its directory probes from the beginning of C<@INC>.

Blessed CODE references in C<@INC> that do not support the C<INC> or
C<INCDIR> methods will no longer trigger an exception, and instead will
be treated the same as unblessed coderefs are, and executed as though
they were an C<INC> hook.

=head2 Forbidden control flow out of C<defer> or C<finally> now detected at compile-time

It is forbidden to attempt to leave a C<defer> or C<finally> block by means
of control flow such as C<return> or C<goto>. Previous versions of perl could
only detect this when actually attempted at runtime.

This version of perl adds compile-time detection for many cases that can be
statically determined. This may mean that code which compiled successfully on
a previous version of perl is now reported as a compile-time error with this
one. This only happens in cases where it would have been an error to actually
execute the code anyway; the error simply happens at an earlier time.

=head2 Optimistic Eval in Patterns

The use of C<(?{ ... })> and C<(??{ ... })> in a pattern disables various
optimisations globally in that pattern. This may or may not be desired by the
programmer. This release adds the C<(*{ ... })> 
equivalent. The only difference is that it does not and will never disable
any optimisations in the regex engine. This may make it more unstable in the
sense that it may be called more or less times in the future, however the
number of times it executes will truly match how the regex engine functions.
For example, certain types of optimisation are disabled when C<(?{ ... })> is
included in a pattern, so that patterns which are O(N) in normal use become
O(N*N) with a C<(?{ ... })> pattern in them. Switching to C<(*{ ... })> means
the pattern will stay O(N).

=head2 New C<class> Feature

A new B<experimental> syntax is now available for defining object classes,
where per-instance data is stored in "field" variables that behave like
lexicals.

    use feature 'class';

    class Point
    {
        field $x;
        field $y;

        method zero { $x = $y = 0; }
    }

This is described in more detail in L<perlclass>.  Notes on the internals of
its implementation and other related details can be found in L<perlclassguts>.

This remains a new and experimental feature, and is very much still under
development. It will be the subject of much further addition, refinement and
alteration in future releases.  As it is experimental, it yields warnings in
the C<experimental::class> category.  These can be silenced by a
C<no warnings> statement.

    use feature 'class';
    no warnings 'experimental::class';

=head2 REG_INF has been raised from 65,536 to 2,147,483,647

Many regex quantifiers used to be limited to U16_MAX in the past, but are
now limited to I32_MAX, thus it is now possible to write /(?:word){1000000}/
for example.  Note that doing so may cause the regex engine to run longer
and use more memory.

=head2 New API functions optimize_optree and finalize_optree

There are two new API functions for operating on optree fragments, ensuring
you can invoke the required parts of the optree-generation process that might
otherwise not get invoked (e.g. when creating a custom LOGOP).  To get access
to these functions, you first need to set a C<#define> to opt-in to using
these functions.

  #define PERL_USE_VOLATILE_API

These functions are closely tied to the internals of how the interpreter
works, and could be altered or removed at any time if other internal changes
make that necessary.

=head1 Security

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 readline() no longer clears the stream error flag

C<readline()>, also spelled C<< <> >>, would clear the handle's error
flag after an error occurred on the stream.

The error flag is now only cleared when an error occurs when reading
from the child process for glob() in F<miniperl>.  This allows it to
correctly report errors from the child process on close().

Since the error flag is no longer cleared calling close() on the
stream may fail and if the stream was not explicitly closed, the
implicit close of the stream may produce a warning.

The eof flag is also not cleared as often, which may cause disruption in code
relying on the old behavior.

[L<GH #20060|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/20060>]

=head2 C<INIT> blocks no longer run after an C<exit()> in C<BEGIN>

C<INIT> blocks will no longer run after an C<exit()> performed inside of
a C<BEGIN>. This means that the combination of the C<-v> option and the
C<-c> option no longer executes a compile check as well as showing the
perl version. The C<-v> option executes an exit(0) after printing the
version information inside of a C<BEGIN> block, and the C<-c> check is
implemented by using C<INIT> hooks, resulting in the C<-v> option taking
precedence.

[L<GH #1537|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/1537>]
[L<GH #20181|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/20181>]

=head2 Syntax errors will no longer produce "phantom error messages".

Generally perl will continue parsing the source code even after
encountering a compile error. In many cases this is helpful, for
instance with misspelled variable names it is helpful to show as many
examples of the error as possible. But in the case of syntax errors
continuing often produces bizarre error messages, and may even cause
segmentation faults during the compile process. In this release the
compiler will halt at the first syntax error encountered. This means
that any code expecting to see the specific error messages we used to
produce will be broken. The error that is emitted will be one of the
diagnostics that used to be produced, but in some cases some messages
that used to be produced will no longer be displayed.

See L<Changes to Existing Diagnostics> for more details.

=head2 L<C<utf8::upgrade()>|utf8/Utility functions>

Starting in this release, if the input string is C<undef>, it remains
C<undef>.  Previously it would be changed into a defined, zero-length
string.

=head2 Changes to "thread-safe" locales

Perl 5.28 introduced "thread-safe" locales on systems that supported
them, namely modern Windows, and systems supporting POSIX 2008 locale
operations.  These systems accomplish this by having per-thread locales,
while continuing to support the older global locale operations for code
that doesn't take the steps necessary to use the newer per-thread ones.

It turns out that some POSIX 2008 platforms have or have had buggy
implementations, which forced perl to not use them.  The
C<${^SAFE_LOCALES}> scalar variable contains 0 or 1 to indicate whether
or not the current platform is considered by perl to have a working
thread-safe implementation.  Some implementations have been fixed
already, but FreeBSD and Cygwin have been newly discovered to be
sufficiently buggy that the thread-safe operations are no longer used by
perl, starting in this release.  Hence, C<${^SAFE_LOCALES}> is now 0 for
them.  Older versions of perl can be configured to avoid these buggy
implementations by adding the F<Configure> option
C<-DNO_POSIX_2008_LOCALE>.

And v5.38 fixes a bug in all previous perls that led to locales not
being fully thread-safe.  The first thread that finishes caused
the main thread (named C<thread0>) to revert to the global locale in
effect at startup, discarding whatever the thread's locale had been
previously set to.  If any other thread had switched to the global
locale by calling C<switch_to_global_locale()> in XS code, those threads
would all share the global locale, and C<thread0> would not be
thread-safe.

=head1 Deprecations

=head2 Use of C<'> as a package name separator is deprecated

Using C<'> as package separator in a variable named in a double-quoted
string has warned since 5.28.  It is now deprecated in both string
interpolation and non-interpolated contexts, and will be removed in
Perl 5.40.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

=over 4

=item *

Additional optree optimizations for common OP patterns. For example, multiple
simple OPs replaced by a single streamlined OP, so as to be more efficient at
runtime. L<[GH #19943]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/19943>,
L<[GH #20063]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/20063>,
L<[GH #20077]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/20077>.

=item *

Creating an anonymous sub no longer generates an C<srefgen> op, the
reference generation is now done in the C<anoncode> or C<anonconst>
op, saving runtime.  [github #20290]

=item *

Temporary ("mortal") copies are no longer created during context exit for
internal static SVs that are in no danger of being prematurely freed.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

=head2 Changes to Existing Diagnostics

=over 4

=item *

The compiler will now stop parsing on the first syntax error it
encounters. Historically the compiler would attempt to "skip past" the
error and continue parsing so that it could list multiple errors. For
things like undeclared variables under strict this makes sense. For
syntax errors however it has been found that continuing tends to result
in a storm of unrelated or bizarre errors that mostly just obscure the
true error. In extreme cases it can even lead to segfaults and other
incorrect behavior.

Therefore we have reformed the continuation logic so that the parse will
stop after the first seen syntax error. Semantic errors like undeclared
variables will not stop the parse, so you may still see multiple errors
when compiling code. However if there is a syntax error it will be the
last error message reported by perl and all of the errors that you see
will be something that actually needs to be fixed.

=item *

Error messages that output class or package names have been modified to
output double quoted strings with various characters escaped so as to
make the exact value clear to a reader. The exact rules on which
characters are escaped may change over time but currently are that
printable ASCII codepoints, with the exception of C<"> and C<\>, and
unicode word characters whose codepoint is over 255 are output raw, and
any other symbols are escaped much as Data::Dumper might escape them,
using C<\n> for newline and C<\"> for double quotes, etc. Codepoints in
the range 128-255 are always escaped as they can cause trouble on
unicode terminals when output raw.

In older versions of perl the one liner

    $ perl -le'"thing\n"->foo()'

would output the following error message exactly as shown here, with
text spread over multiple lines because the "\n" would be emitted as
a raw newline character:

    Can't locate object method "foo" via package "thing
    " (perhaps you forgot to load "thing
    "?) at -e line 1.

As of this release we would output this instead (as one line):

    Can't locate object method "foo" via package "thing\n"
      (perhaps you forgot to load "thing\n"?) at -e line 1.

Notice the newline in the package name has been quoted and escaped, and
thus the error message is a single line. The text is shown here wrapped
to two lines only for readability.

When package or class names in errors are very large the middle excess
portion will be elided from the message. As of this release error messages
will show only up to the first 128 characters and the last 128 characters
in a package or class name in error messages. For example

 $ perl -le'("Foo" x 1000)->new()'

will output the following as one line:

 Can't locate object method "new" via package "FooFooFooFooFooFooFoo
 FooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFoo
 FooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFo"..."oFooFooFooFooFooFooFoo
 FooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFoo
 FooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFoo" (perhaps you forgot to load
 "FooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFoo
 FooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFo"...
 "oFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFoo
 FooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFooFoo"?)
 at -e line 1.

Notice the C< "prefix"..."suffix" > form of the package name in this case.
In previous versions of perl the complete string would have been shown
making the error message over 6k long and there was no upper limit on the
length of the error message at all. If you accidentally used a 1MB string
as a class name then the error message would be over 2MB long. In this perl
the upper limit should be around 2k when eliding and escaping are taken into
account.

Removed C<< Complex regular subexpression recursion limit (%d) exceeded >>

The regular expresion engine has not used recursion in some time. This
warning no longer makes sense.

See [L<GH #19636|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/19636>].

=item *

Various warnings that used to produce parenthesized hints underneath the
main warning message and after its "location data" were chanaged to put
the hint inline with the main message. For instance:

 Bareword found where operator expected at -e line 1, near "foo bar"
     (Do you need to predeclare foo?)

will now look like this but as one line:

 Bareword found where operator expected (Do you need to predeclare
 foo?) at -e line 1, near "foo bar"

as a result such warnings will no longer trigger C<$SIG{__WARN__}>
twice, and the hint will be visible when fatal warnings is in effect.

=item *

The error message that is produced when a C<require> or C<use> statement
fails has been changed. It used to contain the words C<@INC contains:>,
and it used to show the state of C<@INC> *after* the require had
completed and failed. The error message has been changed to say C<@INC
entries checked:> and to reflect the actual directories or hooks that
were executed during the require statement. For example:

    perl -e'push @INC, sub {@INC=()}; eval "require Frobnitz"
        or die $@'
    Can't locate Frobnitz.pm in @INC (you may need to install the
    Frobnitz module) (@INC contains:) at (eval 1) line 1.

Will change to (with some output elided for clarity):

    perl -e'push @INC, sub {@INC=()}; eval "require Frobnitz"
        or die $@'
    Can't locate Frobnitz.pm in @INC (you may need to install the
    Frobnitz module) (@INC entries checked:
    .../site_perl/5.38.0/x86_64-linux .../site_perl/5.38.0
    .../5.38.0/x86_64-linux .../5.38.0 CODE(0x562745e684b8))
    at (eval 1) line 1.

thus showing the actual directories checked. Code that checks for
C<@INC contains:> in error messages should be hardened against any future
wording changes between the C<@INC> and C<:>, for instance use
C<qr/\@INC[ \w]+:/> instead of using C<qr/\@INC contains:/> or
C<qr/\@INC entries checked:/> in tests as this will ensure both forward
and backward compatibility.

C<Configure> probed for the return type of malloc() and free() by

the return types of malloc() and free() are well defined by the C
standard, skip probing for them.  C<Configure> command-line arguments

Perl is no longer manipulating the C<environ> array directly. The variable
C<PL_use_safe_putenv> has been removed and C<PERL_USE_SAFE_PUTENV> is always
defined. This means XS modules can now call C<setenv> and C<putenv> without
causing segfaults. [L<perl #19399|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19399>]

=item *

Internal C API functions are now hidden with C<__attribute__((hidden))> on the
platforms that support it. This means they are no longer callable from XS
modules on those platforms.

It should be noted that those functions have always been hidden on Windows. This
change merely brings that to the other platforms.
[L<perl #19655|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/19655>]

The C<CVf_METHOD> CV flag and associated C<CvMETHOD> macro has been renamed to
C<CVf_NOWARN_AMBIGUOUS> and C<CvNOWARN_AMBIGUOUS>. This closer reflects its
actual behaviour (it suppresses a warning that would otherwise be generated
about ambiguous names), in order to be less confusing with a possible upcoming
feature.

=item *

The C<OPf_SPECIAL> flag is no longer set on the C<OP_ENTERSUB> op
constructed to call the C<VERSION>, C<import> and C<unimport> methods
as part of a C<use> statement and attribute application, nor when
assigning to an C<:lvalue> subroutine.

=item *

A new CV flag C<CVf_REFCOUNTED_ANYSV> has been added, which indicates that the
CV is an XSUB and stores an SV pointer in the C<CvXSUBANY.any_sv> union field.
Perl core operations such as cloning or destroying the CV will maintain the
reference count of the pointed-to SV, destroying it when required.

=item *

A new API function L<perlapi/C<Perl_localeconv>> is added.  This is the
same as L<C<POSIX::localeconv>|POSIX/localeconv> (returning a hash of
the C<localeconv()> fields), but directly callable from XS code.

=item *

A new API function L<perlapi/C<my_strftime8>> is added.  This is the
same as plain L<perlapi/C<my_strftime>>, but with an extra parameter
that allows the caller to simply and reliably know if the returned
string is UTF-8.

=item *

A new API function, L<perlapi/C<Perl_langinfo8>> is added.  This is the
same as plain L<perlapi/C<Perl_langinfo>>, but with an extra parameter
that allows the caller to simply and reliably know if the returned
string is UTF-8.

=item *

We have introduced a limit on the number of nested C<eval EXPR>/C<BEGIN>
blocks and C<require>/C<BEGIN> (and thus C<use> statements as well) to
prevent C stack overflows. This variable can also be used to forbid
C<BEGIN> blocks from executing during C<eval EXPR> compilation. The
limit defaults to C<1000> but can be overridden by setting the
C<${^MAX_NESTED_EVAL_BEGIN_BLOCKS}> variable. The default itself can be
changed at compile time with

    -Accflags='-DPERL_MAX_NESTED_EVAL_BEGIN_BLOCKS_DEFAULT=12345'

Note that this value relates to the size of your C stack and if you
choose an inappropriately large value Perl may segfault, be conservative
about what you choose.

=item *

A new magic type C<PERL_MAGIC_extvalue> has been added. This is available for
use like C<PERL_MAGIC_ext>, but is a value magic: upon localization the new
value will not be magical.

=item *

The C<SSNEW()>, C<SSNEWt()>, C<SSNEWa()> and C<SSNEWat()> APIs now
return a C<SSize_t> value.  The C<SSPTR()> and C<SSPTRt()> macros now
expect a C<SSize_t> parameter, and enforce that on debugging builds.
[github #20411]

=item *

Filenames in cops are now refcounted under threads.
Under threads we were copying the filenames into each opcode. This is because in
theory opcodes created in one thread can be destroyed in another.
The change adds a new struct/type RCPV, which is a refcounted
string using shared memory. This is implemented in such a way that code
that previously used a char * can continue to do so, as the refcounting
data is located a specific offset before the char * pointer itself.

=item *

Added HvNAMEf and HvNAMEf_QUOTEDPREFIX special formats. They take an HV *
as an argument and use C<HvNAME()> and related macros to determine the string,
its length, and whether it is utf8.

=item *

The underlying C<Perl_dowantarray> function implementing the
long-deprecated L<C<GIMME>|perlapi/GIMME> macro has been marked as
deprecated, so that use of the macro emits a compile-time warning.
C<GIMME> has been documented as deprecated in favour of
L<C<GIMME_V>|perlapi/GIMME_V> since Perl v5.6.0, but had not
previously issued a warning.

=item *

The API function L<perlapi/utf8_length> is now more efficient.

When a Perl subroutine tail-calls an XS subroutine using C<goto &xs_sub>,
the XS subroutine can now correctly determine its calling context.
Previously it was always reported as scalar.

In addition, where the Perl subroutine is freed at the same time:

    sub foo { *foo = sub {}; goto &xs_sub }

this formerly could lead to crashes if the XS subroutine tried to use the
value of C<PL_op>, since this was being set to NULL. This is now fixed.

L<[GH #20532]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/20532>

=item *

L<POSIX::strxfrm|POSIX/strxfrm> now uses the C<LC_CTYPE> locale category
to specify its collation, ignoring any differing C<LC_COLLATE>.  It
doesn't make sense for a string to be encoded in one locale (say,
ISO-8859-6, Arabic) and to collate it based on another (like ISO-8859-7,
Greek).  Perl assumes that the current C<LC_CTYPE> locale correctly
represents the encoding, and collates accordingly.

Also, embedded C<NUL> characters are now allowed in the input.

If locale collation is not enabled on the platform (C<LC_COLLATE>), the
input is returned unchanged.

=item *

Double FETCH during stringification of tied scalars returning an
overloaded object have been fixed. The FETCH method should only be
called once, but prior to this release was actually called twice.

C<AUTOLOAD> as C<INC> would have been resolved first.  [L<GH #20665|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/20665>]

=item *

C<$SIG{__DIE__}> will now be called from eval when the code dies during
compilation regardless of how it dies. This means that code expecting to
be able to upgrade C<$@> into an object will be called consistently. In
earlier versions of perl C<$SIG{__DIE__}> would not be called for
certain compilation errors, for instance undeclared variables. For other
errors it might be called if there were more than a certain number of
errors, but not if there were less. Now you can expect that it will be
called in every case.

=item *

Compilation of code with errors used to inconsistently stop depending on
the count and type of errors encountered. The intent was that after 10
errors compilation would halt, but bugs in this logic meant that certain
types of error would be counted, but would not trigger the threshold
check to stop compilation. Other errors would. With this release after
at most 10 errors compilation will terminate, regardless of what type of
error they were.

Note that you can change the maximum count by defining
C<PERL_STOP_PARSING_AFTER_N_ERRORS> to be something else during the
configuration process. For instance

    ./Configure ... -Accflags='-DPERL_STOP_PARSING_AFTER_N_ERRORS=100'

would allow up to 100 errors.

=item *

The API function L<perlapi/my_snprintf> now prints a non-dot decimal
point if the perl code it ultimately is called from is in the scope of
C<use locale> and the locale in effect calls for that.
