=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

[ Within each section, list entries as an =item entry ]

=head1 Diagnostics

The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output,
including warnings and fatal error messages.  For the complete list of
diagnostic messages, see L<perldiag>.

XXX New or changed warnings emitted by the core's C<C> code go here.  Also
include any changes in L<perldiag> that reconcile it to the C<C> code.

=head2 New Diagnostics

XXX Newly added diagnostic messages go under here, separated into New Errors
and New Warnings

=head3 New Errors

=over 4

=item *

L<Unknown locale category %d|perldiag/"Unknown locale category %d">

This is a shortened form of an already existing diagnostic, for use when
there is no new locale being switched to.  The previous diagnostic was
misleading in such circumstances.

=head2 Platform-Specific Notes

XXX List any changes for specific platforms.  This could include configuration
and compilation changes or changes in portability/compatibility.  However,
changes within modules for platforms should generally be listed in the
L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=item DragonflyBSD

Skip tests to workaround an apparent bug in setproctitle().  [L<github #19894|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19894>]

=item FreeBSD

Replace the first part of archname with `uname -p` [L<github #19791|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19791>]

=item Solaris

Avoid some compiler and compilation issues on NetBSD/Solaris from regexec.c and regcomp.c.

=item Synology

Update Synology Readme for DSM 7.

=item Windows

Fix win32 memory alignment needed for gcc-12 from vmem.h.

utimes() on Win32 would print a message to stderr if it failed to
convert a supplied C<time_t> to to a C<FILETIME>. [github #19668]

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

Removed many deprecated C functions.

These have been deprecated for a long time. See
L<https://github.com/perl/perl5/commit/7008caa915ad99e650acf2aea40612b5e48b7ba2>
for a full list.

=item *

C<get_op_descs>, C<get_op_names>, C<get_opargs>, C<get_no_modify> and
C<get_ppaddr> have been marked deprecated.

=item *

C<hv_free_ent> has been marked as internal API.

=item *

C<save_pushptr>, C<save_pushptrptr>, and C<save_pushi32ptr> have been marked
as internal API.

=item *

New bool related functions and macros have been added to complement the new
bool type introduced in 5.36:

The functions are:

=over 4

=item L<C<newSVbool(const bool bool_val)>|perlapi/newSVbool>

=item L<C<newSV_true()>|perlapi/newSV_true>

=item L<C<newSV_false()>|perlapi/newSV_false>

=item L<C<sv_set_true(SV *sv)>|perlapi/sv_set_true>

=item L<C<sv_set_false(SV *sv)>|perlapi/sv_set_false>

=item L<C<sv_set_bool(SV *sv, const bool bool_val)>|perlapi/sv_set_bool>

=back

The macros are:

=over 4

=item L<C<SvIandPOK(sv)>|perlapi/SvIandPOK>

=item L<C<SvIandPOK_off(sv)>|perlapi/SvIandPOK_off>

=item L<C<SvIandPOK_on>|perlapi/SvIandPOK_on>

=back

=item *

Perl is no longer manipulating the C<environ> array directly. The variable
C<PL_use_safe_putenv> has been removed and C<PERL_USE_SAFE_PUTENV> is always
defined. This means XS modules can now call C<setenv> and C<putenv> without
causing segfaults. [L<perl #19399|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19399>]

=item *

Internal C API functions are now hidden with C<__attribute__((hidden))> on the
platforms that support it. This means they are no longer callable from XS
modules on those platforms.

It should be noted that those functions have always been hidden on Windows. This
change merely brings that to the other platforms.
[L<perl #19655|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/19655>]

=item *

New formatting symbols were added for printing values declared as U32 or
I32:

=over

=item I32df -- Like %d

=item U32of -- Like %o

=item U32uf -- Like %u

=item U32xf -- Like %x

=item U32Xf -- Like %X

=back

These are used in the same way already existing similar symbols, such as
C<IVdf>, are used.  See L<perlapi/I/O Formats>.

=item *

new 'HvHasAUX' macro

=item *

regexec.c: Add some branch predictions reorder conds

=item *

locale: Change macro name to be C conformant

=item *

Rename the C<PADNAMEt_*> constants to C<PADNAMEf_*>

=item *

Changes all the API macros that retrieve a PV into a call to an
inline function so as to evaluate the parameter just once.

=item *

regexec.c: multiple code refactor to make the code more readable

=item *

perl.h: Change macro name to be C conformant
(remove leading _ from NOT_IN_NUMERIC macros)

=item *

regcomp.h: add new C<BITMAP_BIT> macro in addition to the existing C<BITMAP_BYTE>
and C<BITMAP_TEST> ones.

=item *

Create new regnode type ANYOFH.
populate_ANYOF_from_invlist was renamed to populate_bitmap_from_invlist

=item *

regex: Refactor bitmap vs non-bitmap of qr/[]/

=item *

regcomp.c: add new functions to convert from an inversion list to a bitmap (and vice versa)
C<populate_bitmap_from_invlist> and C<populate_invlist_from_bitmap>.

=item *

Add C<newAVav()> to create an AV from an existing AV.
Add C<newAVhv()> to create an AV using keys and values from an existing HV.

=item *

Fix definition of C<Perl_atof>.

=item *

Fix undefined behavior with overflow related OPTIMIZE_INFTY and delta
in C<regcomp.c>.

=item *

Fix regnode pointer alignment issue in <regcomp.h>.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

Avoid recursion and stack overflow parsing 'pack' template

[L<GH #16319|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16319>]

=item *

An eval() as the last statement in a regex code block could trigger an
interpreter panic; e.g.

    /(?{ ...; eval {....}; })/

[L<GH #19680|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19680>]

=item *

Disabling the C<bareword_filehandles> feature no longer treats C<< print
Class->method >> as an error.  [L<github #19704|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19704>]

=item *

When a Perl subroutine tail-calls an XS subroutine using C<goto &xs_sub>,
the XS subroutine can now correctly determine its calling context.
Previously it was always reported as scalar.

In addition, where the Perl subroutine is freed at the same time:

    sub foo { *foo = sub {}; goto &xs_sub }

this formerly could lead to crashes if the XS subroutine tried to use the
value of C<PL_op>, since this was being set to NULL. This is now fixed.

[L<github #19936|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19936>]

=item *

setsockopt() now uses the mechanism added in 5.36 to better
distinguish between numeric and string values supplied as the
C<OPTVAL> parameter.  [L<github #18761|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18761>]

=item *

4-argument C<select()> now rejects strings with code points above
255. Additionally, for code points 128-255, this operator will now always
give the corresponding octet to the OS, regardless of how Perl stores
such code points in memory. (Previously Perl leaked its internal string
storage to the OS.) [L<github #19882|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19882>]

=item *

Fix panic issue from C<val {} inside /(?{...})/> [L<github #19390|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19390>]

=item *

Fix multiple compiler warnings from regexp.c., locale.c [L<github #19915|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19915>]

=item *

Fix querying locale without LC_NUMERIC on platform [L<github #19890|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19890>]

=item *

Prevent undefined behaviour in C<S_maybe_multideref()>.

=item *

Avoid signed integer overflow in C<use integer> ops.

=item *

Avoid adding an offset to a NULL pointer in C<hv_delete_common>.
