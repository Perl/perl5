=head1 NAME

perldeprecation - list Perl deprecations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this document is to document what has been deprecated
in Perl, and by which version the deprecated feature will disappear,
or, for already removed features, when it was removed.

This document will try to discuss what alternatives for the deprecated
features are available.

The deprecated features will be grouped by the version of Perl in
which they will be removed.

=head2 Perl 5.30

=head3 C<< File::Glob::glob() >> will disappear

C<< File::Glob >> has a function called C<< glob >>, which just calls
C<< bsd_glob >>. However, its prototype is different from the prototype
of C<< CORE::glob >>, and hence, C<< File::Glob::glob >> should not
be used.

C<< File::Glob::glob() >> was deprecated in Perl 5.8. A deprecation
message was issued from Perl 5.26 onwards, and the function will
disappear in Perl 5.30.

Code using C<< File::Glob::glob() >> should call
C<< File::Glob::bsd_glob() >> instead.

=head2 Perl 5.28

=head3 Attribute "%s" is deprecated, and will disappear in 5.28

The attributes C<< :locked >> (on code references) and C<< :unique >>
(on array, hash and scalar references) have had no effect since 
Perl 5.005 and Perl 5.8.8 respectively. Their use has been deprecated
since.

These attributes will no longer be recognized in Perl 5.28, and will
then result in a syntax error. Since the attributes do not do anything,
removing them from your code fixes the deprecation warning; and removing
them will not influence the behaviour of your code.


=head3 ${^ENCODING} is no longer supported.

The special variable C<${^ENCODING}> was used to implement
the C<encoding> pragma. Setting this variable to anything other
than C<undef> was deprecated in Perl 5.22. Full deprecation
of the variable happened in Perl 5.25.3.

Setting this variable will become a fatal error in Perl 5.28.

=head2 Perl 5.24

=head3 Use of C<< *glob{FILEHANDLE} >>

The use of C<< *glob{FILEHANDLE} >> was deprecated in Perl 5.8.
The intention was to use C<< *glob{IO} >> instead, for which 
C<< *glob{FILEHANDLE} >> is an alias.

However, this feature was undeprecated in Perl 5.24.

=head3 Calling POSIX::%s() is deprecated

The following functions in the C<POSIX> module are no longer available:
C<isalnum>, C<isalpha>, C<iscntrl>, C<isdigit>, C<isgraph>, C<islower>,  
C<isprint>, C<ispunct>, C<isspace>, C<isupper>, and C<isxdigit>.  The 
functions are buggy and don't work on UTF-8 encoded strings.  See their
entries in L<POSIX> for more information.

The functions were deprecated in Perl 5.20, and removed in Perl 5.24.


=head2 Perl 5.16

=head3 Use of %s on a handle without * is deprecated

It used to be possible to use C<tie>, C<tied> or C<untie> on a scalar
while the scalar holds a typeglob. This caused its filehandle to be
tied. It left no way to tie the scalar itself when it held a typeglob,
and no way to untie a scalar that had had a typeglob assigned to it.

This was deprecated in Perl 5.14, and the bug was fixed in Perl 5.16.

So now C<tie $scalar> will always tie the scalar, not the handle it holds.
To tie the handle, use C<tie *$scalar> (with an explicit asterisk).  The same
applies to C<tied *$scalar> and C<untie *$scalar>.


=head2 Perl 5.10

=head3 $* is no longer supported

C<$*> was once a magic variable. C<$*> enabled or disabled
multi-line matching within a string. Deprecated since Perl 5.000,
its special meaning was removed in Perl 5.10. Aftwards, an
deprecation message was issued when using this variable; this message
was discontinued in Perl 5.26.

Instead of using C<$*> you should use the C</m> (and maybe C</s>) regexp
modifiers.  You can enable C</m> for a lexical scope (even a whole file)
with C<use re '/m'>.  (In older versions: when C<$*> was set to a true value
then all regular expressions behaved as if they were written using C</m>.)

Although you can use C<$*> as a normal variable, you are discouraged 
from doing so.

=head3 $# is no longer supported

C<$#> was once a magic variable. C<$#> could be used to format
printed numbers. Deprecated since Perl 5.000,
its special meaning was removed in Perl 5.10. Aftwards, an
deprecation message was issued when using this variable; this message
was discontinued in Perl 5.26.

Instead of using C<$#>, you should be using C<(s)printf> to format
your numbers.

Although you can use C<$#> as a normal variable, you are discouraged 
from doing so.
