=head1 NAME

perl5412delta - what is new for perl v5.41.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.41.1 release and the 5.41.2
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.41.0, first read
L<perl5411delta>, which describes differences between 5.41.0 and 5.41.1.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 New pragma C<L<source::encoding>>

This allows you to declare that the portion of a program for the
remainder of the lexical scope of this pragma is encoded either entirely
in ASCII (for S<C<use source::encoding 'ascii'>>) or if UTF-8 is allowed
as well (for S<C<use source::encoding 'utf8'>>). No other encodings are
accepted. The second form is entirely equivalent to S<C<use utf8>>, and
may be used interchangeably with that.

The purpose of this pragma is to catch cases early where you forgot to
specify S<C<use utf8>>.

S<C<use source::encoding 'ascii'>> is automatically enabled within the
lexical scope of a S<C<use v5.41.0>> or higher.

S<C<no source::encoding>> turns off all this checking for the remainder of
its lexical scope. The meaning of non-ASCII characters is then undefined.

=head1 Internal Changes

=item *

Calls to L<call_argv()|perlapi/call_argv> with the C<G_DISCARD> flag
set also ensure the SV parameters constructed from the C<argv>
parameter are released before C<call_argv()> returns. Previously they
were released on the next L<FREETMPS|perlapi/FREETMPS>. [L<GH #22255|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22255>]

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=item *

C<chdir> now returns real booleans (as its documentation describes), not
integers. This means the result of a failed C<chdir> now stringifies to C<''>,
not C<'0'>.

=head1 Acknowledgements

Perl 5.41.2 represents approximately 3 weeks of development since Perl
5.41.1 and contains approximately 4,100 lines of changes across 180 files
from 13 authors.

Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were
approximately 1,900 lines of changes to 95 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant
community of users and developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.41.2:

Aaron Dill, Dagfinn Ilmari Manns√•ker, Elvin Aslanov, Erik Huelsmann, Graham
Knop, H.Merijn Brand, James E Keenan, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson,
Lukas Mai, Philippe Bruhat (BooK), Russ Allbery, Tony Cook.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please
see the F<AUTHORS> file in the Perl source distribution.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>. There may also be information at
L<https://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>. Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the C<perlthanks> program:

    perlthanks

This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
