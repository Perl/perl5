=head1 NAME

perl5358delta - what is new for perl v5.35.8

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.35.7 release and the 5.35.8
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.35.6, first read
L<perl5357delta>, which describes differences between 5.35.6 and 5.35.7.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Try/Catch Syntax Now Recognises C<finally> Blocks

The experimental C<try>/C<catch> syntax has been extended to support an
optional third block introduced by the C<finally> keyword.

    try {
        attempt();
        print "Success\n";
    }
    catch ($e) {
        print "Failure\n";
    }
    finally {
        print "This happens regardless\n";
    }

This provides code which runs at the end of the C<try>/C<catch> construct,
even if aborted by an exception or control-flow keyword. They are similar
to C<defer> blocks.

For more information, see L<perlsyn/"Try Catch Exception Handling">.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 A physically empty sort is now a compile-time error

    @a = sort @empty; # unaffected
    @a = sort;        # now a compile-time error

A bare sort used to be a weird way to create an empty list; now it croaks
at compile time. This is change is intended to free up some of the syntax
space for possible future enhancements to C<sort>.
