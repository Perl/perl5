=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.9.3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.9.2 and the 5.9.3
development releases. See L<perl590delta>, L<perl591delta> and
L<perl592delta> for the differences between 5.8.0 and 5.9.2.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 Parsing of C<-f _>

C<_> is now forced to be a bareword after a filetest operator. This solves
a number of misparsing issues when a global C<_> subroutine is defined.

=head2 C<defined $$x>

C<use strict "refs"> was ignoring taking a hard reference in an argument
to defined(), as in :

    use strict "refs";
    my $x = "foo";
    if (defined $$x) {...}

This now correctly produces the run-time error C<Can't use string as a
SCALAR ref while "strict refs" in use>. (However, C<defined @$foo> and
C<defined %$foo> are still allowed. Those constructs are discouraged
anyway.)

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://bugs.perl.org/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the B<perlbug>
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of C<perl -V>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.
