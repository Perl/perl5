perlintern - autogenerated documentation of purely B<internal>
		 Perl functions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file is the autogenerated documentation of functions in the
Perl interpreter that are documented using Perl's internal documentation
format but are not marked as part of the Perl API. In other words,
B<they are not for use in extensions>!

=over 8

=item djSP

Declare Just C<SP>. This is actually identical to C<dSP>, and declares
a local copy of perl's stack pointer, available via the C<SP> macro.
See C<SP>.  (Available for backward source code compatibility with the
old (Perl 5.005) thread model.)

=item is_gv_magical

Returns C<TRUE> if given the name of a magical GV.

Currently only useful internally when determining if a GV should be
created even in rvalue contexts.

C<flags> is not used at present but available for future extension to
allow selecting particular classes of magical variable.

	bool	is_gv_magical(char *name, STRLEN len, U32 flags)

=for hackers
Found in file gv.c

=item LVRET

True if this op will be the return value of an lvalue subroutine

=for hackers
Found in file pp.h

=item PL_DBsingle

When Perl is run in debugging mode, with the B<-d> switch, this SV is a
boolean which indicates whether subs are being single-stepped.
Single-stepping is automatically turned on after every step.  This is the C
variable which corresponds to Perl's $DB::single variable.  See
C<PL_DBsub>.

	SV *	PL_DBsingle

=for hackers
Found in file intrpvar.h

=item PL_DBsub

When Perl is run in debugging mode, with the B<-d> switch, this GV contains
the SV which holds the name of the sub being debugged.  This is the C
variable which corresponds to Perl's $DB::sub variable.  See
C<PL_DBsingle>.

	GV *	PL_DBsub

=for hackers
Found in file intrpvar.h

=item PL_DBtrace

Trace variable used when Perl is run in debugging mode, with the B<-d>
switch.  This is the C variable which corresponds to Perl's $DB::trace
variable.  See C<PL_DBsingle>.

	SV *	PL_DBtrace

=for hackers
Found in file intrpvar.h

=item PL_dowarn

The C variable which corresponds to Perl's $^W warning variable.

	bool	PL_dowarn

=for hackers
Found in file intrpvar.h

=item PL_last_in_gv

The GV which was last used for a filehandle input operation. (C<< <FH> >>)

	GV*	PL_last_in_gv

=for hackers
Found in file thrdvar.h

=item PL_ofs_sv

The output field separator - C<$,> in Perl space.

	SV*	PL_ofs_sv

=for hackers
Found in file thrdvar.h

=item PL_rs

The input record separator - C<$/> in Perl space.

	SV*	PL_rs

=for hackers
Found in file thrdvar.h

=item report_uninit

Print appropriate "Use of uninitialized variable" warning

	void	report_uninit()

=for hackers
Found in file sv.c

=item start_glob

Function called by C<do_readline> to spawn a glob (or do the glob inside
perl on VMS). This code used to be inline, but now perl uses C<File::Glob>
this glob starter is only used by miniperl during the build proccess.
Moving it away shrinks pp_hot.c; shrinking pp_hot.c helps speed perl up.

	PerlIO*	start_glob(SV* pattern, IO *io)

=for hackers
Found in file doio.c

=item sv_add_arena

Given a chunk of memory, link it to the head of the list of arenas,
and split it into a list of free SVs.

	void	sv_add_arena(char* ptr, U32 size, U32 flags)

=for hackers
Found in file sv.c

=item sv_clean_all

Decrement the refcnt of each remaining SV, possibly triggering a
cleanup. This function may have to be called multiple times to free
SVs which are in complex self-referential heirarchies.

	I32	sv_clean_all()

=for hackers
Found in file sv.c

=item sv_clean_objs

Attempt to destroy all objects not yet freed

	void	sv_clean_objs()

=for hackers
Found in file sv.c

=item sv_free_arenas

Deallocate the memory used by all arenas. Note that all the individual SV
heads and bodies within the arenas must already have been freed.

	void	sv_free_arenas()

=for hackers
Found in file sv.c

=head1 AUTHORS

The autodocumentation system was originally added to the Perl core by
Benjamin Stuhl. Documentation is by whoever was kind enough to
document their functions.
