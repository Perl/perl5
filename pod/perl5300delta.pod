=head1 NAME

perl5300delta - what is new for perl v5.30.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.28.0 release and the 5.30.0
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.26.0, first read
L<perl5280delta>, which describes differences between 5.26.0 and 5.28.0.

=head1 Notice

sv_utf8_(downgrade|decode) are no longer marked as experimental.
L<[perl #133788]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133788>.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Limited variable length lookbehind in regular expression pattern matching is now experimentally supported

Using a lookbehind assertion (like C<(?<=foo?)> or C<(?<!ba{1,9}r)> previously
would generate an error and refuse to compile.  Now it compiles (if the
maximum lookbehind is at most 255 characters), but raises a warning in
the new C<experimental::vlb> warnings category.  This is to caution you
that the precise behavior is subject to change based on feedback from
use in the field.

See L<perlre/(?<=pattern)> and L<perlre/(?<!pattern)>.

=head2 The upper limit C<"n"> specifiable in a regular expression quantifier of the form C<"{m,n}"> has been doubled to 65534

The meaning of an unbounded upper quantifier C<"{m,}"> remains unchanged.
It matches 2**31 - 1 times on most platforms, and more on ones where a C
language short variable is more than 4 bytes long.

=head2 Unicode 12.1 is supported

Because of a change in Unicode release cycles, Perl jumps from Unicode
10.0 in Perl 5.28 to Unicode 12.1 in Perl 5.30.

For details on the Unicode changes, see
L<https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/> for 11.0;
L<https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode12.0.0/> for 12.0;
and
L<https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode12.1.0/> for 12.1.
(Unicode 12.1 differs from 12.0 only in the addition of a single
character, that for the new Japanese era name.)

The Word_Break property, as in past Perl releases, remains tailored to
behave more in line with expectations of Perl users.  This means that
sequential runs of horizontal white space characters are not broken
apart, but kept as a single run.  Unicode 11 changed from past versions
to be more in line with Perl, but it left several white space characters
as causing breaks: TAB, NO BREAK SPACE, and FIGURE SPACE (U+2007).  We
have decided to continue to use the previous Perl tailoring with regards
to these.

=head2 Wildcards in Unicode property value specifications are now partially supported

You can now do something like this in a regular expression pattern

 qr! \p{nv= /(?x) \A [0-5] \z / }!

which matches all Unicode code points whose numeric value is
between 0 and 5 inclusive.  So, it could match the Thai or Bengali
digits whose numeric values are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

This marks another step in implementing the regular expression features
the Unicode Consortium suggests.

Most properties are supported, with the remainder planned for 5.32.
Details are in L<perlunicode/Wildcards in Property Values>.

=head2 qr'\N{name}' is now supported

Previously it was an error to evaluate a named character C<\N{...}>
within a single quoted regular expression pattern (whose evaluation is
deferred from the normal place).  This restriction is now removed.

=head2 Turkic UTF-8 locales are now seamlessly supported

Turkic languages have different casing rules than other languages for
the characters C<"i"> and C<"I">.  The uppercase of C<"i"> is LATIN
CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE (U+0130); and the lowercase of C<"I"> is LATIN
SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I (U+0131).  Unicode furnishes alternate casing
rules for use with Turkic languages.  Previously, Perl ignored these,
but now, it uses them when it detects that it is operating under a
Turkic UTF-8 locale.

=head2 It is now possible to compile perl to always use thread-safe locale operations.

Previously, these calls were only used when the perl was compiled to be
multi-threaded.  To always enable them, add

 -Accflags='-DUSE_THREAD_SAFE_LOCALE'

to your F<Configure> flags.

=head2 Eliminate opASSIGN macro usage from core

This macro is still defined but no longer used in core

=head2 C<-Drv> now means something on C<-DDEBUGGING> builds

Now, adding the verbose flag (C<-Dv>) to the C<-Dr> flag turns on all
possible regular expression debugging.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 Assigning non-zero to C<$[> is fatal

Setting L<< C<$[>|perlvar/$[ >> to a non-zero value has been deprecated since
Perl 5.12 and now throws a fatal error.
See L<<< perldeprecation/Assigning non-zero to C<< $[ >> is fatal >>>.

=head2 Delimiters must now be graphemes

See L<perldeprecation/Use of unassigned code point or non-standalone grapheme
for a delimiter.>

=head2 Some formerly deprecated uses of an unescaped left brace C<"{"> in
regular expression patterns are now illegal

But to avoid breaking code unnecessarily, most instances that issued a
deprecation warning, remain legal and now have a non-deprecation warning
raised.  See L<perldeprecation/Unescaped left braces in regular expressions>.

=head2 Previously deprecated sysread()/syswrite() on :utf8 handles is now fatal

Calling sysread(), syswrite(), send() or recv() on a C<:utf8> handle,
whether applied explicitly or implicitly, is now fatal.  This was
deprecated in perl 5.24.

There were two problems with calling these functions on C<:utf8>
handles:

=over

=item *

All four functions only paid attention to the C<:utf8> flag.  Other
layers were completely ignored, so a handle with
C<:encoding(UTF-16LE)> layer would be treated as UTF-8.  Other layers,
such as compression are completely ignored with or without the
C<:utf8> flag.

=item *

sysread() and recv() would read from the handle, skipping any
validation by the layers, and do no validation of their own.  This
could lead to invalidly encoded perl scalars.

=back

L<[perl #125760]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125760>.

=head2 my() in false conditional prohibited

Declarations such as C<my $x if 0> are no longer permitted.

L<[perl #133543]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133543>.

=head2 Fatalize $* and $#

These special variables, long deprecated, now throw exceptions when used.

L<[perl #133583]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133583>.

=head2 Fatalize unqualified use of dump()

The C<dump()> function, long discouraged, may no longer be used unless it is
fully qualified, I<i.e.>, C<CORE::dump()>.

L<[perl #133584]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133584>.

=head2 Remove File::Glob::glob()

The C<File::Glob::glob()> function, long deprecated, has been removed and now
throws an exception which advises use of C<File::Glob::bsd_glob()> instead.

L<[perl #133586]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133586>.

=head2 C<pack()> no longer can return malformed UTF-8

It croaks if it would otherwise return a UTF-8 string that contains
malformed UTF-8.  This protects against potential security threats.  This
is considered a bug fix as well.
L<[perl #131642]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131642>.

=head2 Any set of digits in the Common script are legal in a script run of another script

There are several sets of digits in the Common script.  C<[0-9]> is the
most familiar.  But there are also C<[\x{FF10}-\x{FF19}]> (FULLWIDTH
DIGIT ZERO - FULLWIDTH DIGIT NINE), and several sets for use in
mathematical notation, such as the MATHEMATICAL DOUBLE-STRUCK DIGITs.
Any of these sets should be able to appear in script runs of, say,
Greek.  But the design of 5.30 overlooked all but the ASCII digits
C<[0-9]>, so the design was flawed.  This has been fixed, so is both a
bug fix and an incompatibility.
L<[perl #133547]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133547>.

All digits in a run still have to come from the same set of ten digits.

=head2 JSON::PP enables allow_nonref by default

As JSON::XS 4.0 changed its policy and enabled allow_nonref
by default, JSON::PP also enabled allow_nonref by default.

=head1 Deprecations

=head2 In XS code, use of various macros dealing with UTF-8.

This deprecation was scheduled to become fatal in 5.30, but has been
delayed to 5.32 due to problems that showed up with some CPAN modules.
For details of what's affected, see L<perldeprecation|
perldeprecation/In XS code, use of various macros dealing with UTF-8.>.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

=over 4

=item *

Translating from UTF-8 into the code point it represents now is done via a
deterministic finite automaton, speeding it up.  As a typical example,
C<ord("\x7fff")> now requires 12% fewer instructions than before.  The
performance of checking that a sequence of bytes is valid UTF-8 is similarly
improved, again by using a DFA.

=item *

Eliminate recursion from finalize_op().
L<[perl #108276]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=108276>.

=item *

A handful of small optimizations related to character folding
and character classes in regular expressions.

=item *

Optimization of C<IV> to C<UV> conversions.
L<[perl #133677]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133677>.

=item *

Speed up of the integer stringification algorithm by processing
two digits at a time instead of one.
L<[perl #133691]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133691>.

=item *

Improvements based on LGTM analysis and recommendation.
(L<https://lgtm.com/projects/g/Perl/perl5/alerts/?mode=tree>). 
L<[perl #133686]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133686>.
L<[perl #133699]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133699>.

=item *

Code optimizations in F<regcomp.c>, F<regcomp.h>, F<regexec.c>.

=item *

Regular expression pattern matching of things like C<qr/[^I<a>]/> is
significantly sped up, where I<a> is any ASCII character.  Other classes
can get this speed up, but which ones is complicated and depends on the
underlying bit patterns of those characters, so differs between ASCII
and EBCDIC platforms, but all case pairs, like C<qr/[Gg]/> are included,
as is C<[^01]>.

=head2 Removed Modules and Pragmata

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

As noted under L<Incompatible Changes> above, the deprecation warning
"Unescaped left brace in regex is deprecated here (and will be fatal in Perl

changed to the non-deprecation warning "Unescaped left brace in regex is passed
through in regex; marked by S<<-- HERE> in m/%s/".

=item *

Specifying C<\o{}> without anything between the braces now yields the
fatal error message "Empty \o{}".  Previously it was  "Number with no

with similar constructs such as C<\p{}>.

=item *

Within the scope of the experimental feature C<use re 'strict'>,
specifying C<\x{}> without anything between the braces now yields the
fatal error message "Empty \x{}".  Previously it was  "Number with no
digits".  This means the same wording is used for this kind of error as
with similar constructs such as C<\p{}>.  It is legal, though not wise
to have an empty C<\x> outside of C<re 'strict'>; it silently generates
a NUL character.

=item HP-UX 11.11

An obscure problem in C<pack()> when compiling with HP C-ANSI-C has been fixed
by disabling optimizations in F<pp_pack.c>.

=item Mac OS X

Perl's build and testing process on Mac OS X for C<-Duseshrplib>
builds is now compatible with Mac OS X System Integrity Protection
(SIP).

SIP prevents binaries in F</bin> (and a few other places) being passed
the C<DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH> environment variable.  For our purposes this
prevents C<DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH> from being passed to the shell, which
prevents that variable being passed to the testing or build process,
so running C<perl> couldn't find F<libperl.dylib>.

To work around that, the initial build of the F<perl> executable
expects to find F<libperl.dylib> in the build directory, and the
library path is then adjusted during installation to point to the
installed library.

also available in F<win32/GNUmakefile> (for B<gmake>).

=item *

The B<nmake> makefile no longer defaults to Visual C++ 6.0 (a very old version
which is unlikely to be widely used today).  As a result, it is now a
requirement to specify the C<CCTYPE> since there is no obvious choice of which
modern version to default to instead.  Failure to specify C<CCTYPE> will result
in an error being output and the build will stop.

(The B<dmake> and B<gmake> makefiles will automatically detect which compiler
is being used, so do not require C<CCTYPE> to be set.  This feature has not yet
been added to the B<nmake> makefile.)

A new function L<perlapi/C<my_strtod>> or its synonym, Strtod(), is
now available with the same signature as the libc strtod().  It provides
strotod() equivalent behavior on all platforms, using the best available
precision, depending on platform capabilities and F<Configure> options,
while handling locale-related issues, such as if the radix character
should be a dot or comma.

L<[perl #132964]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132964>.

=item *

It is now forbidden to malloc more than C<PTRDIFF_T_MAX> bytes.  Much
code (including C optimizers) assumes that all data structures will not
be larger than this, so this catches such attempts before overflow
happens.

=item *

Two new regnodes have been introduced C<< EXACT_ONLY8 >>, and
C<< EXACTFU_ONLY8 >>. They're equivalent to C<< EXACT >> and C<< EXACTFU >>,
except that they contain a code point which requires UTF-8 to
represent/match. Hence, if the target string isn't UTF-8, we know
it can't possibly match, without needing to try.

C<< print_bytes_for_locale() >> is now defined if C<< DEBUGGING >>,

=item *

The handling of user-defined C<\p{}> properties (see
L<perlunicode/User-Defined Character Properties>) has been rewritten to
be in C (instead of Perl).  This speeds things up, but in the process
several inconsistencies and bug fixes are made.

=over 4

=item 1

A few error messages have minor wording changes.  This is essentially
because the new way is integrated into the regex error handling
mechanism that marks the position in the input at which the error
occurred.  That was not possible previously.  The messages now also
contain additional back-trace-like information in case the error occurs
deep in nested calls.

=item 2

A user-defined property is implemented as a perl subroutine with certain
highly constrained naming conventions.  It was documented previously
that the sub would be in the current package if the package was
unspecified.  This turned out not to be true in all cases, but now it
is.

=item 3

All recursive calls are treated as infinite recursion.  Previously they
would cause the interpreter to panic.  Now, they cause the regex pattern
to fail to compile.

=item 4

Similarly, any other error likely would lead to a panic; now to just the
pattern failing to compile.

=item 5

The old mechanism did not detect illegal ranges in the definition of the
property.  Now, the range max must not be smaller than the range min.
Otherwise, the pattern fails to compile.

=item 6

The intention was to have each sub called only once during the lifetime
of the program, so that a property's definition is immutable.  This was
relaxed so that it could be called once for all /i compilations, and
potentially a second time for non-/i (the sub is passed a parameter
indicating which).  However, in practice there were instances when this
was broken, and multiple calls were possible.  Those have been fixed.
Now (besides the /i,non-/i cases) the only way a sub can be called
multiple times is if some component of it has not been defined yet.  For
example, suppose we have sub IsA() whose definition is known at compile
time, and it in turn calls isB() whose definition is not yet known.
isA() will be called each time a pattern it appears in is compiled.  If
isA() also calls isC() and that definition is known, isC() will be
called just once.

=item 7

There were some races and very long hangs should one thread be compiling
the same property as another simultaneously.  These have now been fixed.

=back

=item *

Fixed a failure to match properly.

An EXACTFish regnode has a finite length it can hold for the string
being matched.  If that length is exceeded, a second node is used for
the next segment of the string, for as many regnodes as are needed.
Care has to be taken where to break the string, in order to deal
multi-character folds in Unicode correctly. If we want to break a
string at a place which could potentially be in the middle of a
multi-character fold, we back off one (or more) characters, leaving
a shorter EXACTFish regnode. This backing off mechanism contained
an off-by-one error.
L<[perl #133756]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133756>.

=item *

A bare C<eof> call with no previous file handle now returns true.
L<[perl #133721]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133721>

=item *

Failing to compile a format now aborts compilation.  Like other errors
in sub-parses this could leave the parser in a strange state, possibly
crashing perl if compilation continued.
L<[perl #132158]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132158>

=item *

If an in-place edit is still in progress during global destruction and
the process exit code (as stored in C<$?>) is zero, perl will now
treat the in-place edit as successful, replacing the input file with
any output produced.

This allows code like:

  perl -i -ne 'print "Foo"; last'

to replace the input file, while code like:

  perl -i -ne 'print "Foo"; die'

will not.  Partly resolves
L<[perl #133659]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133659>.

=item *

A regression in 5.28 caused the following code to fail

 close(STDIN); open(CHILD, "|wc -l")'

because the child's stdin would be closed on exec. This has now been fixed.

=item *

Fixed an issue where compiling a regexp containing both compile-time
and run-time code blocks could lead to trying to compile something
which is invalid syntax.

=item *

Fixed build failures with C<< -DNO_LOCALE_NUMERIC >> and
C<< -DNO_LOCALE_COLLATE >>.
L<[perl #133696]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133696>.

=item *

Prevent the tests in F<< ext/B/t/strict.t >> from being skipped.
L<[perl #133713]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133713>.

=item *

C<< /di >> nodes ending or beginning in I<s> are now C<< EXACTF >>. We do not
want two C<< EXACTFU >> to be joined together during optimization,
and to form a C<< ss >>, C<< sS >>, C<< Ss >> or C<< SS >> sequence;
they are the only multi-character sequences which may match differently
under C<< /ui >> and C<< /di >>.

the names of most of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported
issues to the Perl bug tracker. Noteworthy in this release were the large
number of bug fixes made possible by Sergey Aleynikov's high quality perlbug
reports for issues he discovered by fuzzing with AFL.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.
