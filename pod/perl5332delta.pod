=head1 Configuration and Compilation

=over 4

=item * C<-Dusedefaultstrict>

EXPERIMENTAL: Perl can now be built with L<strict> on by default (using the
configuration option C<-Dusedefaultstrict>.

These strict defaults do not apply when C<perl> is run via C<-e> or C<-E>.

This setting provides a diagnostic mechanism for perl developers for
development and is intended for development purposes only and is thus turned
on by default.

=head1 Acknowledgements

Perl 5.33.2 represents approximately 4 weeks of development since Perl
5.33.1 and contains approximately 18,000 lines of changes across 380 files
from 19 authors.

Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were
approximately 11,000 lines of changes to 260 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant
community of users and developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.33.2:

Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Christian Walde (Mithaldu), Craig A. Berry, Dagfinn
Ilmari Manns√•ker, David Mitchell, H.Merijn Brand, Hugo van der Sanden,
James E Keenan, John Lightsey, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Nicholas

Tom Hukins, Tony Cook.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

see the F<AUTHORS> file in the Perl source distribution.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  There may also be information at

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.
