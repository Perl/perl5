=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file. Any text flagged as
XXX needs to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.13.4

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.13.4 release and
the 5.13.3 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.13.2, first read
L<perl5133delta>, which describes differences between 5.13.2 and
5.13.3.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here. Summarise user-visible core language
enhancements. Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX. If any
    exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.
In particular, deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are
listed as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

[ List each deprecation as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here. There
may well be none in a stable release.

[ List each enhancement as a =item * entry ]

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>, which prints stub
entries to STDOUT.  Results can be pasted in place of the '=head2' entries
below.  A paragraph summary for important changes should then be added by hand.
In an ideal world, dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be
cribbed.

=head2 Updated Modules and Pragmata

=over 4

=item C<Archive::Tar>

Upgraded from version 1.64 to 1.66.

Among other things, the new version adds a new option to C<ptar> to allow safe
creation of tarballs without world-writable files on Windows, allowing those
archives to be uploaded to CPAN.

=item C<B::Lint>

Upgraded from version 1.11 to 1.12.

=item C<Carp>

Upgraded from version 1.16 to 1.18.

L<Carp> now detects incomplete L<caller()|perlfunc/"caller EXPR"> overrides and
avoids using bogus C<@DB::args>. This fixes certain cases of C<Bizarre copy of
ARRAY> caused by modules overriding C<caller()> incorrectly.

=item C<Compress::Raw::Bzip2>

Upgraded from version 2.027 to 2.030.

=item C<Compress::Raw::Zlib>

Upgraded from version 2.027 to 2.030.

=item C<File::Spec>

Upgraded from version 3.31 to 3.31_01.

Various issues in L<File::Spec::VMS> have been fixed.

=item C<IO::Compress>

Upgraded from version 2.027 to 2.030.

=item Removed C<PERL_POLLUTE>

The option to define C<PERL_POLLUTE> to expose older 5.005 symbols for backwards
compatibility has been removed. It's use was always discouraged, and MakeMaker
contains a more specific escape hatch:

    perl Makefile.PL POLLUTE=1

This can be used for modules that have not been upgraded to 5.6 naming
conventions (and really should be completely obsolete by now).

=item Declare API incompatibility between blead releases

Only stable releases (5.10.x, 5.12.x, 5.14.x, ...) guarantee binary
compatibility with each other, while blead releases (5.13.x, 5.15.x, ...) often
break this compatibility. However, prior to perl 5.13.4, all blead releases had
the same C<PERL_API_REVISION>, C<PERL_API_VERSION>, and C<PERL_API_SUBVERSION>,
effectively declaring them as binary compatible, which they weren't. From now
on, blead releases will have a C<PERL_API_SUBVERSION> equal to their
C<PERL_SUBVERSION>, explicitly marking them as incompatible with each other.

Maintainance releases of stable perl's will continue to make no intentionally
incompatible changes.

=item Make extending the peephole optimizer easier

As of version 5.8, extension authors were allowed to replace perl's peephole
optimizer function. However, this was B<very> hard to do, as there was no way to
add new optimizations without having to copy large parts of perl's original
optimizer. This problem is now solved by a rework of the optimizer extension
API. See L<perlguts/"Compile pass 3: peephole optimization"> for details.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

Fixed possible memory leak when using L<caller()|perlfunc/"caller EXPR"> to set
C<@DB::args>.

Several memory leaks when loading XS modules were fixed.

=item *

A panic in the regular expression optimizer has been fixed (RT#75762).

=item *

Assignments to lvalue subroutines now honor copy-on-write behavior again, which
has been broken since version 5.10.0 (RT#75656).

=head1 Known Problems

XXX Descriptions of platform agnostic bugs we know we can't fix go here. Any
tests that had to be C<TODO>ed for the release would be noted here, unless
they were specific to a particular platform (see below).

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the B<perlbug>
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of C<perl -V>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently
distributed on CPAN.
