=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.33.6 release and the 5.33.7

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Experimental Try/Catch Syntax

An initial experimental attempt at providing C<try>/C<catch> notation has
been added.

    use feature 'try';

    try {
        a_function();
    }
    catch ($e) {
        warn "An error occurred: $e";
    }

For more information, see L<perlsyn/"Try Catch Exception Handling">.

=head1 Documentation

=head2 Changes to Existing Documentation

We have attempted to update the documentation to reflect the changes
listed in this document.  If you find any we have missed, open an issue
at L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.

Additionally, the following selected changes have been made:

=head3 L<perlfunc>

=over 4

=item *

L<my()|perlfunc/my> and L<state()|perlfunc/state> now explicitly warn
the reader that lexical variables should typically not be redeclared
within the same scope or statement.

=head1 Diagnostics

The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output,
including warnings and fatal error messages.  For the complete list of
diagnostic messages, see L<perldiag>.

=head2 Changes to L<perldiag>

L<perldiag> was missing some entries for existing diagnostics.

=item * Error %s in expansion of %s

An error was encountered in handling a user-defined property
(L<perlunicode/User-Defined Character Properties>).  These are
programmer written subroutines, hence subject to errors that may
prevent them from compiling or running.

=item * Infinite recursion in user-defined property

A user-defined property (L<perlunicode/User-Defined Character Properties>)
can depend on the definitions of other user-defined
properties.  If the chain of dependencies leads back to this property,
infinite recursion would occur, were it not for the check that raised
this error.

=item * Timeout waiting for another thread to define \p{%s}

The first time a user-defined property
(L<perlunicode/User-Defined Character Properties>) is used, its
definition is looked up and converted into an internal form for more
efficient handling in subsequent uses.  There could be a race if two or
more threads tried to do this processing nearly simultaneously.

=item * Unknown user-defined property name \p{%s}

You specified to use a property within the C<\p{...}> which was a
syntactically valid user-defined property, but no definition was found
for it

=head1 Configuration and Compilation

=item * stadtx hash support has been removed

stadtx support has been entirely removed.  Previously, it could be requested
with PERL_HASH_FUNC_STADTX, and was default in 64-bit builds.  It has been
replaced with SipHash.  SipHash has been more rigorously reviewed than stadtx.

=head1 Platform Support

=head2 Platform-Specific Notes

=over 4

=item Windows

Building with mingw.org compilers (version 3.4.5 or later) using mingw runtime
versions < 3.22 now works again.  This was broken in Perl 5.31.4.

Building with mingw.org compilers (version 3.4.5 or later) using mingw runtime
versions >= 3.21 now works (for compilers up to version 5.3.0).

Makefile.mk, and thus support for dmake, has been removed. It is still possible
to build Perl on Windows using nmake (Makefile) and GNU make (GNUmakefile).

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=item * pack/unpack format 'D' now works on all systems that could support it

Previously if C<NV == long double>, now it is supported on all platforms that
have long doubles. In particular that means it is now also supported on
quadmath platforms.

=head1 Obituary

Kent Fredric (KENTNL) passed away in February 2021.  A native of New Zealand
and a self-described "huge geek," Kent was the author or maintainer of 178
CPAN distributions, the Perl maintainer for the Gentoo Linux distribution and
a contributor to the Perl core distribution.  He is mourned by his family,
friends and open source software communities worldwide.

=head1 Acknowledgements

Perl 5.33.7 represents approximately 4 weeks of development since Perl
5.33.6 and contains approximately 11,000 lines of changes across 230 files
from 19 authors.

Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were
approximately 2,800 lines of changes to 140 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant
community of users and developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.33.7:

Andy Dougherty, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Craig A. Berry, Dan Book, Eugene
Alvin Villar, H.Merijn Brand, Hugo van der Sanden, James E Keenan, Karl
Williamson, Leon Timmermans, Paul Evans, Ricardo Signes, Richard Leach,
Sawyer X, Steve Hay, Tomasz Konojacki, Tony Cook, Yves Orton, Zakariyya
Mughal.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks
