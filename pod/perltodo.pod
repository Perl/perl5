=head1 NAME

perltodo - Link to the Perl to-do list

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Perl 5 to-do list is maintained in the git repository, and can
be viewed at L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/blob/blead/Porting/todo.pod>.

(The to-do list used to be here in perltodo. That has stopped, as installing a
snapshot that becomes increasingly out of date isn't that useful to anyone.)
