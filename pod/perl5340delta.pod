=head1 NAME

perl5340delta - what is new for perl v5.34.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.32.0 release and the 5.34.0
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.30.0, first read
L<perl5320delta>, which describes differences between 5.30.0 and 5.32.0.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Experimental Try/Catch Syntax

An initial experimental attempt at providing C<try>/C<catch> notation has
been added.

    use feature 'try';

    try {
        a_function();
    }
    catch ($e) {
        warn "An error occurred: $e";
    }

For more information, see L<perlsyn/"Try Catch Exception Handling">.

=head2 C<qr/{,n}/> is now accepted

An empty lower bound is now accepted for regular expression quantifiers,
like C<m/x{,3}/> meaning C<m/x{0,3}/>

=cut


=head2 Blanks freely allowed within but adjacent to curly braces

(in double-quotish contexts and regular expression patterns)

This means you can write things like S<C<\x{ FFFC }>> if you like.  This
applies to all such constructs, namely C<\b{}>, C<\g{}>, C<\k{}>,
C<\N{}>, C<\o{}>, and C<\x{}>; as well as the regular expression
quantifier C<{I<m>,I<n>}>.  C<\p{}> and C<\P{}> retain their
already-existing, even looser, rules mandated by the Unicode standard
(see L<perluniprops/Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}>).

This ability is in effect regardless of the presence of the C</x>
regular expression pattern modifier.

Additionally, the comma in a regular expression braced quantifier may
have blanks (tabs or spaces) before and/or after the comma, like
S<C<qr/a{ 5, 7 }/>>.

=head2 New octal syntax C<0oI<ddddd>>

It is now possible to specify octal literals with C<0o> prefixes,
as in C<0o123_456>, parallel to the existing construct to specify
hexadecimal literal C<0xI<ddddd>> and binary literal C<0bI<ddddd>>.
Also, the builtin C<oct()> function now accepts this new syntax.

See L<perldata/Scalar value constructors> and L<perlfunc/oct EXPR>.

L<Error %s in expansion of %s|perldiag/"Error %s in expansion of %s">

An error was encountered in handling a user-defined property
(L<perlunicode/User-Defined Character Properties>).  These are
programmer written subroutines, hence subject to errors that may
prevent them from compiling or running.

=item *

L<Infinite recursion in user-defined property|perldiag/"Infinite recursion in user-defined property">

A user-defined property (L<perlunicode/User-Defined Character Properties>)
can depend on the definitions of other user-defined

infinite recursion would occur, were it not for the check that raised
this error.

Perl can now be built with L<strict> on by default (using the configuration
option C<-Dusedefaultstrict>.

These strict defaults do not apply when C<perl> is run via C<-e> or C<-E>.

This setting provides a diagnostic mechanism intended for development

versions >= 3.21 now works (for compilers up to version 5.3.0).

F<Makefile.mk>, and thus support for dmake, has been removed. It is still
possible to build Perl on Windows using nmake (Makefile) and GNU make
(GNUmakefile).
[L<GH #18511|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/18511>]

perl can now be built with C<USE_QUADMATH> on MS Windows using
(32-bit and 64-bit) mingw-w64 ports of gcc.
[L<GH #18465|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/18465>]

The F<pl2bat.pl> utility now needs to C<use ExtUtils::PL2Bat>. This could
cause failures in parallel builds.

Windows now supports L<symlink()|perlfunc/symlink> and
L<readlink()|perlfunc/readlink>, and L<lstat()|perlfunc/lstat> is no
longer an alias for L<stat()|perlfunc/stat>.
[L<GH #18005|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18005>].

Unlike POSIX systems, creating a symbolic link on Windows requires
either elevated privileges or Windows 10 1703 or later with Developer
Mode enabled.

stat(), including C<stat FILEHANDLE>, and lstat() now uses our own
implementation that populates the device C<dev> and inode numbers
C<ino> returned rather than always returning zero.  The number of
links C<nlink> field is now always populated.

L<< C<${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT}> |perlvar/${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT} >> previously
controlled whether the C<nlink> field was populated requiring a
separate Windows API call to fetch, since C<nlink> and the other
information required for C<stat()> is now retrieved in a single API call.

The C<-r> and C<-w> operators now return true for the C<STDIN>,
C<STDOUT> and C<STDERR> handles.  Unfortunately it still won't return
true for duplicates of those handles.
[L<GH #8502|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/8502>].

The times returned by stat() and lstat() are no longer incorrect
across Daylight Savings Time adjustments.
[L<GH #6080|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/6080>].

C<-x> on a filehandle should now match C<-x> on the corresponding
filename on Vista or later.
[L<GH #4145|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/4145>].

C<-e '"'> no longer incorrectly returns true.
[L<GH #12431|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/12431>].

The same manifest is now used for Visual C++ and gcc builds.

Previously, MSVC builds were using the B</manifestdependency> flag instead of
embedding F<perlexe.manifest>, which caused issues such as C<GetVersionEx()>
returning the wrong version number on Windows 10.

=item z/OS

The locale categories C<LC_SYNTAX> and C<LC_TOD> are now recognized.
Perl doesn't do anything with these, except it now allows you to specify
them.  They are included in C<LC_ALL>.

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

Corrected handling of double and long double parameters for perl's
implementation of formatted output for C<-Dusequadmath> builds.

This applies to C<PerlIO_printf()>, C<croak()>, C<warn()>, C<sv_catpvf()> and
their variants.

Previously in C<quadmath> builds, code like:

  PerlIO_printf(PerlIO_stderr(), "%g", somedouble);

or

  PerlIO_printf(PerlIO_stderr(), "%Lg", somelongdouble);

would erroneously throw an exception "panic: quadmath invalid format
...", since the code added for quadmath builds assumed C<NV>s were the
only floating point format passed into these functions.

This code would also process the standard C long double specifier C<L>
as if it expected an C<NV> (C<__float128> for quadmath builds),
resulting in undefined behaviour.

These functions now correctly accept doubles, long doubles and NVs.

=item *

Previously the right operand of bitwise shift operators (shift amount)
was implicitly cast from IV to int, but it might lead wrong results
if IV does not fit in int.

And also, shifting INT_MIN bits used to yield the shiftee unchanged
(treated as 0-bit shift instead of negative shift).

=item *

A set of C<cop_hints_exists_{pv,pvn,pvs,sv}> functions was added,
to support checking for the existence of keys in the hints hash of a
specific cop without needing to create a mortal copy of said value.

=item *

An aid has been added for using the C<DEBUG> macros when debugging XS or
C code. The comments in F<perl.h> describe C<DEBUG_PRE_STMTS> and
C<DEBUG_POST_STMTS>. which you can C<#define> to do things like save and
restore C<errno>, in case the C<DEBUG> calls are interfering with that,
or to display timestamps, or which thread it's coming from, or the
location of the call, or whatever.  You can make a quick hack to help
you track something down without having to edit individual C<DEBUG>
calls.

=item *

Make C<REFCOUNTED_HE_EXISTS> available outside of core

=item *

All C<SvTRUE>-ish functions now evaluate their arguments exactly once.
In 5.32, plain L<perlapi/C<SvTRUE>> was changed to do that; now the rest
do as well.

=item *

Unicode is now a first class citizen when considering the pattern /A*B/ where
A and B are arbitrary.  The pattern matching code tries to make a tight loop
to match the span of A's.  The logic of this was now really updated with
support for UTF-8.

=item *

The L<re> module has a new function C<optimization>, which can return a
hashref of optimization data discovered about a compiled regexp.

=item *

The C<PERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT> compilation option has been removed, and
with it the need or the C<dVAR> macro.  C<dVAR> remains defined as a
no-op outside C<PERL_CORE> for backwards compatiblity with XS modules.

=item *

A new savestack type C<SAVEt_HINTS_HH> has been added, which neatens the
previous behaviour of C<SAVEt_HINTS>.  On previous versions the types and
values pushed to the save stack would depend on whether the hints included the
C<HINT_LOCALIZE_HH> bit, which complicates external code that inspects the
save stack. The new version uses a different savestack type to indicate the
difference.

=item *

A new API function L<perlapi/av_count> has been added which gives a
clearly named way to find how many elements are in an array.

=back

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

Setting C<%ENV> now properly handles upgraded strings in the key. Previously
Perl sent the SV's internal PV directly to the OS; now it will handle keys
as it has handled values since 5.18: attempt to downgrade the string first;
if that fails then warn and use the utf8 form.

=item *

Fix a memory leak in regcomp.c
[L<GH #18604|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18604>]

=item * pack/unpack format 'D' now works on all systems that could support it

Previously if C<NV == long double>, now it is supported on all platforms that
have long doubles. In particular that means it is now also supported on
quadmath platforms.

=item *

Skip trying to constant fold an incomplete op tree
[L<GH #18380|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18380>]

Constant folding of chained comparison op trees could fail under certain
conditions, causing perl to crash. As a quick fix, constant folding is
now skipped for such op trees. This also addresses
[L<GH #17917|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17917>].

=item *

C<%g> formatting broken on Ubuntu-18.04, C<NVSIZE == 8>
[L<GH #18170|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18170>]

Buggy libc implementations of the C<gcvt> and C<qgcvt> functions
caused C<(s)printf> to incorrectly truncate C<%g> formatted numbers.
A new Configure probe now checks for this, with the result that the libc
C<sprintf> will be used in place of C<gcvt> and C<qgcvt>.

Tests added as part of this fix also revealed related problems in
some Windows builds. The makefiles for MINGW builds on Windows have
thus been adjusted to use C<USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO> by default, ensuring
that they also provide correct C<(s)printf> formatting of numbers.

=item *

F<op.c>: croak on C<my $_> when C<use utf8> is in effect
[L<GH #18449|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18449>]

The lexical topic feature experiment was removed in Perl v5.24 and
declaring C<my $_> became a compile time error. However, it was previously
still possible to make this declaration if C<use utf8> was in effect.

=item *

F<regexec.c>: Fix assertion failure
[L<GH #18451|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18451>]

Fuzzing triggered an assertion failure in the regexp engine when too many
characters were copied into a buffer.

=item *

L<semctl()|perlfunc/semctl>, L<msgctl()|perlfunc/msgctl>, and
L<shmctl()|perlfunc/shmctl> now properly reset the UTF-8 flag on the
C<ARG> parameter if it's modified for C<IPC_STAT> or C<GETALL>
operations.

=item *

C<semctl()>, C<msgctl()>, and C<shmctl()> now attempt to downgrade the C<ARG>
parameter if its value is being used as input to C<IPC_SET> or
C<SETALL> calls.  A failed downgrade will thrown an exception.

=item *

In cases where C<semctl()>, C<msgctl()> or C<shmctl()> would treat the C<ARG>
parameter as a pointer, an undefined value no longer generates a
warning.  In most such calls the pointer isn't used anyway and this
allows you to supply C<undef> for a value not used by the underlying
function.

=item *

L<semop()|perlfunc/semop> now downgrades the C<OPSTRING> parameter,
L<msgsnd()|perlfunc/msgsnd> now downgrades the C<MSG> parameter and
L<shmwrite|perlfunc/shmwrite> now downgrades the C<STRING> parameter
to treat them as bytes.  Previously they would be left upgraded,
providing a corrupted structure to the underlying function call.

=item *

L<msgrcv()|perlfunc/msgrcv> now properly resets the UTF-8 flag the
C<VAR> parameter when it is modified.  Previously the UTF-8 flag could
be left on, resulting in a possibly corrupt result in C<VAR>.

=item *

Magic is now called correctly for stacked file test operators.
[L<GH #18293|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18293>]

=item *

The C<@ary = split(...)> optimization no longer switches in the target
array as the value stack.
[L<GH #18232|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18232>]
Also see discussion at
L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/18014#issuecomment-671299506>.

=item *

Fixed a bug in which some regexps with recursive subpatterns matched
incorrectly.

[L<GH #18096|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18096>]

=item *

On Win32, C<waitpid(-1, WNOHANG)> could sometimes have a very large
timeout.  [L<GH #16529|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16529>]

=item *

C<MARK> and hence C<items> are now correctly initialized in C<BOOT> XSUBs.

=item *

Some list assignments involving C<undef> on the left-hand side were
over-optimized and produced incorrect results.
