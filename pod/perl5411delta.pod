=head1 NAME

perl5411delta - what is new for perl v5.41.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.41.0 release and the 5.41.1
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.40.0, first read
L<perl5410delta>, which describes differences between 5.40.0 and 5.41.0.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 More CORE:: subs

C<chdir> has been added as a subroutine to the CORE:: namespace.

Previously, code like C<&CORE::chdir($dir)> or C<< my $ref = \&CORE::chdir;
$ref->($dir) >> would throw an error saying C<&CORE::chdir cannot be called
directly>. These cases are now fully supported.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

Various optimizations related to handling of C<CONST>s.

C<Perl_leave_adjust_stacks>: additional efficiency for mortal copies.

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

The L<perlapi/C<sv_strftime_ints>> function is introduced.  This is an
enhanced version of L<perlapi/C<my_strftime>>, which is retained for
backwards compatibility.  Both are to call L<strftime(3)> when you have
the year, month, hour, etc.  The new function handles UTF8ness for you,
and allows you to specify if you want the possibility of daylight
savings time to be considered.  C<my_strftime> never considers DST.

=item *

The C<bytes_to_utf8>, C<bytes_from_utf8>, and C<bytes_from_utf8_loc>
functions are no longer experimental.
