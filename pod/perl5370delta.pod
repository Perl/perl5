Perl 5.37.0 represents approximately 2 hours of development since Perl
5.36.0 and contains approximately 3,600 lines of changes across 37 files
from 1 author.

Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were
approximately 61 lines of changes to 6 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

community of users and developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.37.0:
