=head1 NAME

perl5357delta - what is new for perl v5.35.7

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.35.6 release and the 5.35.7
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.35.5, first read
L<perl5356delta>, which describes differences between 5.35.5 and 5.35.6.


=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 builtin Functions

A new core module L<builtin> has been added, which provides documentation for
new always-present functions that are built into the interpreter.

    say "Reference type of arrays is ", builtin::reftype([]);

It also provides a lexical import mechanism for providing short name versions
of these functions.

    use builtin 'reftype';
    say "Reference type of arrays is ", reftype([]);

An initial set of functions exists to provide convenient access to stable
boolean values, weakening references, and inspecting properties of references.

This builtin function mechanism and the functions it provides are all
currently B<experimental>.

For more information, see the L<builtin> module.

=head1 Platform Support


=head2 Platform-Specific Notes

=over 4

=item z/OS

This update enables us to build EBCDIC static/dynamic
and 31-bit/64-bit addressing mode Perl. The number of
tests that pass is consistent with the baseline before
these updates.

These changes also provide the base support to be able to provide
ASCII static/dynamic and 31-bit/64-bit addressing mode Perl.

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item * A new phase_name() interface provides access to the name
for each interpreter phase (i.e., PL_phase value).

=item * The changes in v5.35.5 for how memory for hash iterator state was allocated could cause unbounded memory consumption (until process exit). The bug that caused this has been fixed - memory consumption is now stable, and potentially lower than v5.35.4 and earlier.

=for The v5.36.0 perldelta, just drop the paragraph about the bugfix.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=item *

When bareword filehandles are disabled, the parser was interpreting
any bareword as a filehandle, even when immediatey followed by parens.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case.

inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.
