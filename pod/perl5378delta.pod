=head1 NAME

perl5378delta - what is new for perl v5.37.8

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.37.7 release and the 5.37.8
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.37.6, first read
L<perl5377delta>, which describes differences between 5.37.6 and 5.37.7.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Optimistic Eval in Patterns

The use of C<(?{ ... })> and C<(??{ ... })> in a pattern disables various
optimisations globally in that pattern. This may or may not be desired by the
programmer. This release adds the C<(*{ ... })> and C<(**{ ... })>
equivalents. The only difference is that they do not and will never disable
any optimisations in the regex engine. This may make them more unstable in the
sense that they may be called more or less times in the future, however the
number of times they execute will truly match how the regex engine functions.
For example, certain types of optimisation are disabled when C<(?{ ... })> is
included in a pattern, so that patterns which are O(N) in normal use become
O(N*N) with a C<(?{ ... })> pattern in them. Switching to C<(*{ ... })> means
the pattern will stay O(N).

=head2 Platform-Specific Notes

=item Windows

=over

=item *

lstat() on Windows now returns the length of the link target as the
size of the file, as it does on POSIX systems.  [github #20476]

=item *

symlink() on Windows now replaces any C</> in the target with C<\>,
since Windows does not recognise C</> in symbolic links.  The reverse
translation is B<not> done by readlink().  [github #20506]

=item *

symlink() where the target was an absolute path to a directory was
incorrectly created as a file symbolic link.  [github #20533]

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

Added HvNAMEf and HvNAMEf_QUOTEDPREFIX special formats. They take an HV *
as an argument and use C<HvNAME()> and related macros to determine the string,
its length, and whether it is utf8.
