perllexwarn - Perl Lexical Warnings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl v5.6.0 introduced lexical control over the handling of warnings by
category.  The C<warnings> pragma generally replaces the command line flag
B<-w>.  Documentation on the use of lexical warnings, once partly found in
this document, is now found in the L<warnings> documentation.
