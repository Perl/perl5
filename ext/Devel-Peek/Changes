	A lot of new fields stolen from sv_dump();
0.86:
	By Gisle Aas:
	   - Updated the documentation.
	   - Move string printer to it's own function: fprintpv()
	   - Use it to print PVs, HV keys, MG_PTR
	   - Don't print IV for hashes as KEY is the same field
	   - Tag GvSTASH as "GvSTASH" in order to not confuse it with
	     the other STASH field, e.g.  Dump(bless \*foo, "bar")
0.87:
	Extra indentation of SvRV.
	AMAGIC removed.
	Head of OOK data printed too.
0.88:
	PADLIST and OUTSIDE of CVs itemized.
	Prints the value of the hash of HV keys.
	Changes by Gisle: do not print both if AvARRAY == AvALLOC;
			  print hash fill statistics.
0.89:
	Changes by Gisle: optree dump.
0.90:
	DumpWithOP, DumpProg exported.
	Better indent for AV, HV elts.
	Address of SV printed.
	Corrected Zero code which was causing segfaults.
0.91:
	Compiles, runs test under 5.005beta2.
	Update DEBUGGING_MSTATS-less MSTATS.
0.92:
	Should compile without MYMALLOC too.
0.94:
	Had problems with HEf_SVKEY magic.
0.95:
	Added "hash quality" output to estimate Perl's hash functions.

1.02:
	2004-10-22: Document "hash quality" output and update examples.

1.09:
	2012-07-23: Modify tests for 5.18's slightly different flags.
1.10:
