# 2 purpose file: 1-test 2-demonstrate (via args, -v -a options)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

To verify that B::Concise properly reports whether functions are XS,
perl, or optimized constant subs, we test against a few core packages
which have a stable API, and which have functions of all 3 types.

=head1 WHAT IS TESTED

5 core packages are tested; Digest::MD5, B, B::Deparse, Data::Dumper,
and POSIX.  These have a mix of the 3 expected implementation types;
perl, XS, and constant (optimized constant subs).

%$testpkgs specifies what packages are tested; each package is loaded,
and the stash is scanned for the function-names in that package.

Each value in %$testpkgs is a hash-of-lists (HoL) whose keys are
implementation-types and values are lists of function-names of that type.

To keep these HoLs smaller and more manageable, they may carry an
additional 'dflt' => $impl_Type, which means that unnamed functions
are expected to be of that default implementation type.  Those unnamed
functions are known from the scan of the package stash.

=head1 HOW THEY'RE TESTED

Each function is 'rendered' by B::Concise, and result is matched
against regexs for each possible implementation-type.  For some
packages, some functions may be unimplemented on some platforms.

To slay this maintenance dragon, the regexs used in like() match
against renderings which indicate that there is no implementation.

If a function is implemented differently on different platforms, the
test for that function will fail on one of those platforms.  These
specific functions can be skipped by a 'skip' => [ @list ] to the HoL
mentioned previously.  See usage for skip in B's HoL, which avoids
testing a function which doesn't exist on non-threaded builds.

=head1 OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS

C<-v> and C<-V> trigger 2 levels of verbosity.

C<-a> uses Module::CoreList to run all core packages through the test, which
gives some interesting results.

C<-c> causes the expected XS/non-XS results to be marked with
corrections, which are then reported at program END, in a form that's
readily cut-and-pastable into this file.


C<< -r <file> >> reads a file, as written by C<-c>, and adjusts the expected
results accordingly.  The file is 'required', so @INC settings apply.

If module-names are given as args, those packages are run through the
test harness; this is handy for collecting further items to test, and
may be useful otherwise (ie just to see).

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 4

=item ./perl -Ilib -wS ext/B/t/concise-xs.t -c Storable

Tests Storable.pm for XS/non-XS routines, writes findings (along with
test results) to stdout.  You could edit results to produce a test
file, as in next example

=item ./perl -Ilib -wS ext/B/t/concise-xs.t -r ./storable

Loads file, and uses it to set expectations, and run tests

=item ./perl -Ilib -wS ext/B/t/concise-xs.t -avc > ../foo-avc 2> ../foo-avc2

Gets module list from Module::Corelist, and runs them all through the
test.  Since -c is used, this generates corrections, which are saved
in a file, which is edited down to produce ../all-xs

=item ./perl -Ilib -wS ext/B/t/concise-xs.t -cr ../all-xs > ../foo 2> ../foo2

This runs the tests specified in the file created in previous example.
-c is used again, and stdout verifies that all the expected results
given by -r ../all-xs are now seen.

Looking at ../foo2, you'll see 34 occurrences of the following error:

# err: Can't use an undefined value as a SCALAR reference at
# lib/B/Concise.pm line 634, <DATA> line 1.
