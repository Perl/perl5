      * IO::Compress::Base
        - Fixed problem that prevented the creation of a zip file that
          contained more than one compression method.

      * IO::Compress::Base::Common
        - The private Validator class in this module clashes with another
          CPAN module. Moved Validator into the IO::Compress::Base::Common
          namespace.
          [RT #35954]

  2.010 5 May 2008

      * Fixed problem that meant Perl 5.10 could not upgrade this module.
        [RT #35342]

  2.009 20 April 2008

      * Removed the alpha status from File::GlobMapper
      
      * IO::Compress::Base 
        When writing output never output a zero length buffer.
        Done to improve interoperability with other tied filenandle
        modules.

      * Changed IO::Uncompress::Base to not use the offset parameter of
        the read method when reading from a filehandle. 

        The object returned from Net::FTP::retr implements a non-standard
        read method. The third parameter is used for a timeout value
        rather than an offset.  
        [rt.cpan#33231]
        
      * Changed IO::Uncompress::Base to not use the eof method when
        reading from a filehandle. 

        The object returned from Net::FTP::retr implements both the read
        method and the eof method. Unfortunately the implementation of
        the read method uses non-buffered IO (by using sysread) while
        the eof method uses buffered IO. Mixing buffered and non-buffered
        IO results in data corruption.

  2.008 2 November 2007

      * Minor documentation changes in README

  2.006 1 September 20007

      * Makefile.PL
        Added INSTALLDIRS directive to install as a core module when built
        on a perl >= 5.9.

  2.005 18 June 2007

      * Stephen Turner reported a problem when using IO::Uncompress::Gunzip
        with XML::Parser. Turns out there were two issues.  

        Firstly an IO::Uncompress object isn't an IO::Handle. It is now.

        Secondly the implementation of "read" wasn't honouring this 

            SCALAR will be grown or shrunk to the length actually read.

        In particular it didn't do the right thing on EOF.
        This has been fixed.

  2.004 3 March 2007

      * Made seek less wasteful of memory.

  2.003 2 January 2007

      * Added explicit version checking

  2.002 29 December 2006

      * Documentation updates.

      * Added IO::Handle to the ISA test in isaFilehandle

      * Add an explicit use_ok test for Scalar::Util in the test harness.
        The error message reported by 01misc implied the problem was
        somewhere else.
        Also explictly check that 'dualvar' is available.

  2.001 1 November 2006

      * Remove beta status.

  2.000_14 26 October 2006

      * IO::Uncompress::Base
        Added support for $/ in record mode

      * IO::Uncompress::Base
        The readline interface was substantially slower than the 1.x
        equivalent. This has now been sorted. 
        Thanks to Andreas J. Koenig for spotting the problem.

      * IO::Uncompress::AnyUncompress
        Added IO::Uncompress::Lzf to the list of supported uncompresors.

      * IO::Uncompress::Base
        Added TrailingData to one-shot interface.

      * IO::Uncompress::AnyUncompress
        Remove raw-deflate (RFC1951) from the default list of compressors 
        to check.
        It can still be included if the new RawInflate parameter is
        supplied.
        This change was made because the only way to tell if content is 
        raw-deflate is to attempt to uncompress it - a few false positives
        have popped up recently, which suggests that auto-detecting raw 
        deflate is far from perfect.
        The equivalent change has been made to IO::Uncompress::AnyInflate.
        [Core patch #28445]

      * Don't check that filehandles are writable. It would seem that 
        "-w *STDOUT" on windows returns false. 
        [Core Patch #28415]

  2.000_13 20 June 2006

      * Store compress & uncompressed sizes as 64-bit.

      * For one-shot uncompression, like this

            unzip "some.zip" => \@a, MultiStream => 1;

        Push each uncompressed stream from "some.zip" onto @a.

      * Added IO::Compress::Base::FilterEnvelope

      * Added IO::Uncompress::Base::nextStream

      * The '-' filehandle now maps to either *STDIN or *STDOUT. 
        This keeps mod_perl happier. Was using these before

            new IO::File("<-")
            new IO::File(">-")
  
  2.000_12 3 May 2006

  2.000_11 10 April 2006

      * Transparent + InputLength made more robust where input data is not
        compressed.

  2.000_10 13 March 2006

      * AnyUncompress doesn't assume  that IO-Compress-Zlib is installed any
        more.

  2.000_09 3 March 2006

      * Released to CPAN.

  2.000_08 2 March 2006

      * Split IO::Compress::Base into its own distribution.

      * Added opened, autoflush and input_line_number.

      * Beefed up support for $.
