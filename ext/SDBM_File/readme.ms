A The Clone of the \fIndbm\fP library
.PP
The sources accompanying this notice \(em \fIsdbm\fP \(em constitute
the first public release (Dec. 1990) of a complete clone of
the Berkeley UN*X \fIndbm\fP library. The \fIsdbm\fP library is meant to
clone the proven functionality of \fIndbm\fP as closely as possible,
including a few improvements. It is practical, easy to understand, and
compatible.
The \fIsdbm\fP library is not derived from any licensed, proprietary or
copyrighted software.
.PP
The \fIsdbm\fP implementation is based on a 1978 algorithm
[Lar78] by P.-A. (Paul) Larson known as "Dynamic Hashing".
In the course of searching for a substitute for \fIndbm\fP, I
prototyped three different external-hashing algorithms [Lar78, Fag79, Lit80]
and ultimately chose Larson's algorithm as a basis of the \fIsdbm\fP
implementation. The Bell Labs
\fIdbm\fP (and therefore \fIndbm\fP) is based on an algorithm invented by
Ken Thompson, [Tho90, Tor87] and predates Larson's work.
.PP
The \fIsdbm\fR programming interface is totally compatible
with \fIndbm\fP and includes a slight improvement in database initialization.
It is also expected to be binary-compatible under most UN*X versions that
support the \fIndbm\fP library.
.PP
The \fIsdbm\fP implementation shares the shortcomings of the \fIndbm\fP
library, as a side effect of various simplifications to the original Larson
algorithm. It does produce \fIholes\fP in the page file as it writes
pages past the end of file. (Larson's paper include a clever solution to
this problem that is a result of using the hash value directly as a block
address.) On the other hand, extensive tests seem to indicate that \fIsdbm\fP
creates fewer holes in general, and the resulting pagefiles are
smaller. The \fIsdbm\fP implementation is also faster than \fIndbm\fP
in database creation.
Unlike the \fIndbm\fP, the \fIsdbm\fP
.CW store
operation will not "wander away" trying to split its
data pages to insert a datum that \fIcannot\fP (due to elaborate worst-case
situations) be inserted. (It will fail after a pre-defined number of attempts.)
.SH
Important Compatibility Warning
.PP
The \fIsdbm\fP and \fIndbm\fP
libraries \fIcannot\fP share databases: one cannot read the (dir/pag)
database created by the other. This is due to the differences
between the \fIndbm\fP and \fIsdbm\fP algorithms\**, 
.FS
Torek's discussion [Tor87]
indicates that \fIdbm/ndbm\fP implementations use the hash
value to traverse the radix trie differently than \fIsdbm\fP
and as a result, the page indexes are generated in \fIdifferent\fP order.
For more information, send e-mail to the author.
.FE
and the hash functions
used.
It is easy to convert between the \fIdbm/ndbm\fP databases and \fIsdbm\fP
by ignoring the index completely: see
.CW dbd ,
.CW dbu
etc.

The

developed late one night, just to test out \fIsdbm\fP, and convert some
databases.

like Bell Labs'
.CW cbt
utility. It is currently incomplete in functionality.
I use
.CW dbu
to test out the routines: it takes (from stdin) tab separated
key/value pairs for commands like
.CW build
or
.CW insert
or takes keys for
commands like
.CW delete
or
.CW look .

.CW dba
is a crude analyzer of \fIdbm/sdbm/ndbm\fP
page files. It scans the entire
page file, reporting page level statistics, and totals at the end.
.PP
.CW dbd
is a crude dump program for \fIdbm/ndbm/sdbm\fP
databases. It ignores the
bitmap, and dumps the data pages in sequence. It can be used to create
input for the
.CW dbu 
utility.
Note that
.CW dbd
will skip any NULLs in the key and data
fields, thus is unsuitable to convert some peculiar databases that
insist in including the terminating null.
.PP
I have also included a copy of the
.CW dbe
(\fIndbm\fP DataBase Editor) by Janick Bergeron [janick@bnr.ca] for
your pleasure. You may find it more useful than the little
.CW dbu
utility.
.PP
.CW dbm.[ch]
is a \fIdbm\fP library emulation on top of \fIndbm\fP
(and hence suitable for \fIsdbm\fP). Written by Robert Elz.
.PP
The \fIsdbm\fP
library has been around in beta test for quite a long time, and from whatever
little feedback I received (maybe no news is good news), I believe it has been
functioning without any significant problems. I would, of course, appreciate
all fixes and/or improvements. Portability enhancements would especially be
useful.
.SH
Implementation Issues
.PP
Hash functions:
The algorithm behind \fIsdbm\fP implementation needs a good bit-scrambling
hash function to be effective. I ran into a set of constants for a simple
hash function that seem to help \fIsdbm\fP perform better than \fIndbm\fP
for various inputs:
.P1
	/*
	 * polynomial conversion ignoring overflows
	 * 65599 nice. 65587 even better.
	 */
	long
	dbm_hash(char *str, int len) {
		unsigned long n = 0;
	
		while (len--)
			n = n * 65599 + *str++;
		return n;
	}
.P2
.PP
There may be better hash functions for the purposes of dynamic hashing.
Try your favorite, and check the pagefile. If it contains too many pages
with too many holes, (in relation to this one for example) or if
\fIsdbm\fP
simply stops working (fails after 
.CW SPLTMAX
attempts to split) when you feed your
NEWS 
.CW history
file to it, you probably do not have a good hashing function.
If you do better (for different types of input), I would like to know
about the function you use.
.PP
Block sizes: It seems (from various tests on a few machines) that a page
file block size
.CW PBLKSIZ
of 1024 is by far the best for performance, but
this also happens to limit the size of a key/value pair. Depending on your
needs, you may wish to increase the page size, and also adjust
.CW PAIRMAX
(the maximum size of a key/value pair allowed: should always be at least
three words smaller than
.CW PBLKSIZ .)
accordingly. The system-wide version of the library
should probably be
configured with 1024 (distribution default), as this appears to be sufficient
for most common uses of \fIsdbm\fP.
.SH
Portability
.PP
This package has been tested in many different UN*Xes even including minix,
and appears to be reasonably portable. This does not mean it will port
easily to non-UN*X systems.
.SH
Notes and Miscellaneous
.PP
The \fIsdbm\fP is not a very complicated package, at least not after you
familiarize yourself with the literature on external hashing. There are
other interesting algorithms in existence that ensure (approximately)
single-read access to a data value associated with any key. These are
directory-less schemes such as \fIlinear hashing\fP [Lit80] (+ Larson
variations), \fIspiral storage\fP [Mar79] or directory schemes such as
\fIextensible hashing\fP [Fag79] by Fagin et al. I do hope these sources
provide a reasonable playground for experimentation with other algorithms.
See the June 1988 issue of ACM Computing Surveys [Enb88] for an
excellent overview of the field.
