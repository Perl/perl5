Errno 1.10 -- Wed Dec 27 08:20:29 CST 2006

 * Update with all changes made to core perl repository


Change 171 on 2000-09-12 by <calle@lysator.liu.se> (Calle Dybedahl)

	- Fixed filename-extracting regexp to allow whitespace between
	  "#" and "line", which the cpp on Unicos 9 produces.

Change 170 on 1998/07/05 by <gbarr@pobox.com> (Graham Barr)

	Fixed three problems reported by Hans Mulder for NeXT
	
	- Errno_pm.PL does not recognize #define lines because they have
	  whitespace before the '#'.  ANSI does not allow that in portable
	  code; that didn't stop the author of NeXT's <errno.h>.
	
	- Cpp output lines look like this:	#1 "errno.c"
	  Errno_pm.PL does not recognize that format; it wants whitespace
	  before the line number.
	
	- Cpp does a syntax check on files with names ending in ".c"; it
	  reports fatal errors on input lines like:	"ENOSYS" [[ENOSYS]]
	  Workaround: use $Config{cppstdin}, like Errno 1.04 did.

Change 160 on 1998/06/27 by <gbarr@pobox.com> (Graham Barr)
