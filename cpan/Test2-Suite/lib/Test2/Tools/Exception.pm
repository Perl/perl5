=head1 NAME

Test2::Tools::Exception - Test2 based tools for checking exceptions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the L<Test2> implementation of code used to test exceptions. This is
similar to L<Test::Fatal>, but it intentionally does much less.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test2::Tools::Exception qw/dies lives/;

    like(
        dies { die 'xxx' },
        qr/xxx/,
        "Got exception"
    );

    ok(lives { ... }, "did not die") or note($@);

=head1 EXPORTS

All subs are exported by default.

=over 4

=item $e = dies { ... }

This will trap any exception the codeblock throws. If no exception is thrown
the sub will return undef. If an exception is thrown it will be returned. This
function preserves C<$@>, it will not be altered from its value before the sub
is called.

=item $bool = lives { ... }

This will trap any exception thrown in the codeblock. It will return true when
there is no exception, and false when there is. C<$@> is preserved from before
the sub is called when there is no exception. When an exception is trapped
C<$@> will have the exception so that you can look at it.

=item $bool = try_ok { ... }

=item $bool = try_ok { ... } "Test Description"

This will run the code block trapping any exception. If there is no exception a
passing event will be issued. If the test fails a failing event will be issued,
and the exception will be reported as diagnostics.

B<Note:> This function does not preserve C<$@> on failure, it will be set to
the exception the codeblock throws, this is by design so that you can obtain
the exception if desired.

=back

=head1 DIFFERENCES FROM TEST::FATAL

L<Test::Fatal> sets C<$Test::Builder::Level> such that failing tests inside the
exception block will report to the line where C<exception()> is called. I
disagree with this, and think the actual line of the failing test is
more important. Ultimately, though L<Test::Fatal> cannot be changed, people
probably already depend on that behavior.
