=head1 NAME

Test2::Tools::Subtest - Tools for writing subtests

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package exports subs that let you write subtests.

There are two types of subtests, buffered and streamed. Streamed subtests mimic
subtests from L<Test::More> in that they render all events as soon as they are
produced. Buffered subtests wait until the subtest completes before rendering
any results.

The main difference is that streamed subtests are unreadable when combined with
concurrency. Buffered subtests look fine with any number of concurrent threads
and processes.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head2 BUFFERED

    use Test2::Tools::Subtest qw/subtest_buffered/;

    subtest_buffered my_test => sub {
        ok(1, "subtest event A");
        ok(1, "subtest event B");
    };

This will produce output like this:

    ok 1 - my_test {
        ok 1 - subtest event A
        ok 2 - subtest event B
        1..2
    }

=head2 STREAMED

The default option is 'buffered'. If you want streamed subtests,
the way L<Test::Builder> does it, use this:

    use Test2::Tools::Subtest qw/subtest_streamed/;

    subtest_streamed my_test => sub {
        ok(1, "subtest event A");
        ok(1, "subtest event B");
    };

This will produce output like this:

    # Subtest: my_test
        ok 1 - subtest event A
        ok 2 - subtest event B
        1..2
    ok 1 - Subtest: my_test

=head1 IMPORTANT NOTE

You can use C<bail_out> or C<skip_all> in a subtest, but not in a BEGIN block
or C<use> statement. This is due to the way flow control works within a BEGIN
block. This is not normally an issue, but can happen in rare conditions using
eval, or script files as subtests.

=head1 EXPORTS

=item subtest_streamed $name => $sub

=item subtest_streamed($name, $sub, @args)

=item subtest_streamed $name => \%params, $sub

=item subtest_streamed($name, \%params, $sub, @args)

Run subtest coderef, stream events as they happen.

C<\%params> is a hashref with any arguments you wish to pass into hub
construction.

=item subtest_buffered $name => $sub

=item subtest_buffered($name, $sub, @args)

=item subtest_buffered $name => \%params, $sub

=item subtest_buffered($name, \%params, $sub, @args)

Run subtest coderef, render events all at once when subtest is complete.

C<\%params> is a hashref with any arguments you wish to pass into hub
construction.
