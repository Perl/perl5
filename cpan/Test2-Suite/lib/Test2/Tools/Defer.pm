=head1 NAME

Test2::Tools::Defer - Write tests that get executed at a later time

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sometimes you need to test things BEFORE loading the necessary functions. This
module lets you do that. You can write tests, and then have them run later,
after C<Test2> is loaded. You tell it what test function to run, and what
arguments to give it.  The function name and arguments will be stored to be
executed later. When ready, run C<do_def()> to kick them off once the functions
are defined.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use Test2::Tools::Defer;

    BEGIN {
        def ok => (1, 'pass');
        def is => ('foo', 'foo', 'runs is');
        ...
    }

    use Test2::Tools::Basic;

    do_def(); # Run the tests

    # Declare some more tests to run later:
    def ok => (1, "another pass");
    ...

    do_def(); # run the new tests

    done_testing;

=head1 EXPORTS

=over 4

=item def function => @args;

This will store the function name, and the arguments to be run later. Note that
each package has a separate store of tests to run.

=item do_def()

This will run all the stored tests. It will also reset the list to be empty so
you can add more tests to run even later.
