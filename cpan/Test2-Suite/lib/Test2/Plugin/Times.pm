=head1 NAME

Test2::Plugin::Times - Output timing data at the end of the test.

=head1 CAVEAT

It is important to note that this timing data does not include global
destruction. This data is only collected up until the point done_testing() is
called. If your program takes time for END blocks, garbage collection, and
similar, then this timing data will fall short of reality.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin will output a diagnostics message at the end of testing that tells
you how much time elapsed, and how hard the system worked on the test.

This will produce a string like one of these (Note these numbers are completely
made up). I<Which string is used depends on the time elapsed.>

    0.12345s on wallclock (0.05 usr 0.00 sys + 0.00 cusr 0.00 csys = 0.05 CPU)

    11.1234s on wallclock (0.05 usr 0.00 sys + 0.00 cusr 0.00 csys = 0.05 CPU)

    01m:54.45s on wallclock (0.05 usr 0.00 sys + 0.00 cusr 0.00 csys = 0.05 CPU)

    18h:22m:54.45s on wallclock (0.05 usr 0.00 sys + 0.00 cusr 0.00 csys = 0.05 CPU)

    04d:18h:22m:54.45s on wallclock (0.05 usr 0.00 sys + 0.00 cusr 0.00 csys = 0.05 CPU)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test2::Plugin::Times;

This is also useful at the command line for 1-time use:

    $ perl -MTest2::Plugin::Times path/to/test.t
