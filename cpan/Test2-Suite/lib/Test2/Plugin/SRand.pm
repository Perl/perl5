=head1 NAME

Test2::Plugin::SRand - Control the random seed for more controlled test
environments.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module gives you control over the random seed used for your unit tests. In
some testing environments the random seed can play a major role in results.

The default configuration for this module will seed srand with the local date.
Using the date as the seed means that on any given day the random seed will
always be the same, this means behavior will not change from run to run on a
given day. However the seed is different on different days allowing you to be
sure the code still works with actual randomness.

The seed is printed for you on failure, or when the harness is verbose. You can
use the C<T2_RAND_SEED> environment variable to specify the seed. You can also
provide a specific seed as a load-time argument to the plugin.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Loading the plugin is easy, and the defaults are sane:

    use Test2::Plugin::SRand;

Custom seed:

    use Test2::Plugin::SRand seed => 42;

=head1 NOTE ON LOAD ORDER

If you use this plugin you probably want to use it as the first, or near-first
plugin. C<srand> is not called until the plugin is loaded, so other plugins
loaded first may already be making use of random numbers before your seed
takes effect.
