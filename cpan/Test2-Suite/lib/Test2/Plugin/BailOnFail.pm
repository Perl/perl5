=head1 NAME

Test2::Plugin::BailOnFail - Automatically bail out of testing on the first test
failure.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module will issue a bailout event after the first test failure. This will
prevent your tests from continuing. The bailout runs when the context is
released; that is, it will run when the test function you are using, such as
C<ok()>, returns. This gives the tools the ability to output any extra
diagnostics they may need.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test2::V0;
    use Test2::Plugin::BailOnFail;

    ok(1, "pass");
    ok(0, "fail");
    ok(1, "Will not run");
