=head1 NAME

Test2::Bundle::More - ALMOST a drop-in replacement for Test::More.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This bundle is intended to be a (mostly) drop-in replacement for
L<Test::More>. See L<"KEY DIFFERENCES FROM Test::More"> for details.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test2::Bundle::More;

    ok(1, "pass");

    ...

    done_testing;

=head1 PLUGINS

This loads L<Test2::Plugin::ExitSummary>.

=head1 TOOLS

These are from L<Test2::Tools::Basic>. See L<Test2::Tools::Basic> for details.

=head1 KEY DIFFERENCES FROM Test::More

=over 4

=item You cannot plan at import.

THIS WILL B<NOT> WORK:

    use Test2::Bundle::More tests => 5;

Instead you must plan in a separate statement:

    use Test2::Bundle::More;
    plan 5;

=item You have three subs imported for use in planning

Use C<plan($count)>, C<skip_all($reason)>, or C<done_testing()> for your
planning.

=item isa_ok accepts different arguments

C<isa_ok> in Test::More was:

    isa_ok($thing, $isa, $alt_thing_name);

This was very inconsistent with tools like C<can_ok($thing, @subs)>.

In Test2::Bundle::More, C<isa_ok()> takes a C<$thing> and a list of C<@isa>.

    isa_ok($thing, $class1, $class2, ...);

=head2 THESE FUNCTIONS AND VARIABLES HAVE BEEN REMOVED

=over 4

=item $TODO

See C<todo()>.

=item use_ok()

=item require_ok()

These are not necessary. Use C<use> and C<require> directly. If there is an
error loading the module the test will catch the error and fail.

=item todo_skip()

Not necessary.

=item eq_array()

=item eq_hash()

=item eq_set()

Discouraged in Test::More.

=item explain()

This started a fight between Test developers, who may now each write their own
implementations in L<Test2>. (See explain in L<Test::Most> vs L<Test::More>.
Hint: Test::Most wrote it first, then Test::More added it, but broke
compatibility).

=item new_ok()

Not necessary.
