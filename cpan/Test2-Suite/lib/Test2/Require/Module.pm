=head1 NAME

Test2::Require::Module - Skip tests if certain packages are not installed, or
insufficient versions.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sometimes you have tests that are nice to run, but depend on tools that may not
be available. Instead of adding the tool as a dep, or making the test always
skip, it is common to make the test run conditionally. This package helps make
that possible.

This module is modeled after L<Test::Requires>. The difference is that this
module is based on L<Test2> directly, and does not go through L<Test::Builder>.
Another difference is that the packages you check for are not imported into
your namespace for you. This is intentional.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # The test will be skipped unless Some::Module is installed, any version.
    use Test2::Require::Module 'Some::Module';

    # The test will be skipped unless 'Other::Module' is installed and at
    # version '5.555' or greater.
    use Test2::Require::Module 'Other::Module' => '5.555';

    # We now need to use them directly, Test2::Require::Module does not import
    # them for us.
    use Some::Module;
    use Other::Module;
