=head1 NAME

Test2::Require::EnvVar - Only run a test when a specific environment variable
is set.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

It is common practice to write tests that are only run when an environment
variable is set. This module automates the (admittedly trivial) work of creating
such a test.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test2::Require::EnvVar 'SOME_VAR';

    ...

    done_testing;
