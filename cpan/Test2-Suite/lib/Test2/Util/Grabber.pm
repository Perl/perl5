=head1 NAME

Test2::Util::Grabber - Object used to temporarily intercept all events.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Once created this object will intercept and stash all events sent to the shared
L<Test2::Hub> object. Once the object is destroyed, events will once
again be sent to the shared hub.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test2 qw/Core Grab/;

    my $grab = grab();

    # Generate some events, they are intercepted.
    ok(1, "pass");
    ok(0, "fail");

    my $events_a = $grab->flush;

    # Generate some more events, they are intercepted.
    ok(1, "pass");
    ok(0, "fail");

    # Same as flush, except it destroys the grab object.
    my $events_b = $grab->finish;

After calling C<finish()> the grab object is destroyed and C<$grab> is set to
undef. C<$events_a> is an arrayref with the first two events. C<$events_b> is an
arrayref with the second two events.

=head1 EXPORTS

=over 4

=item $grab = grab()

This lets you intercept all events for a section of code without adding
anything to your call stack. This is useful for things that are sensitive to
changes in the stack depth.

    my $grab = grab();
        ok(1, 'foo');
        ok(0, 'bar');

    # $grab is magically undef after this.
    my $events = $grab->finish;

    is(@$events, 2, "grabbed two events.");

When you call C<finish()> the C<$grab> object will automagically undef itself,
but only for the reference used in the method call. If you have other
references to the C<$grab> object they will not be set to undef.

If the C<$grab> object is destroyed without calling C<finish()>, it will
automatically clean up after itself and restore the parent hub.

    {
        my $grab = grab();
        # Things are grabbed
    }
    # Things are back to normal

By default the hub used has C<no_ending> set to true. This will prevent the hub
from enforcing that you issued a plan and ran at least one test. You can turn
enforcement back one like this:

    $grab->hub->set_no_ending(0);

With C<no_ending> turned off, C<finish> will run the post-test checks to
enforce the plan and that tests were run. In many cases this will result in
additional events in your events array.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item $grab = $class->new()

Create a new grab object, immediately starts intercepting events.

=item $ar = $grab->flush()

Get an arrayref of all the events so far, clearing the grab objects internal
list.

=item $ar = $grab->events()

Get an arrayref of all events so far. Does not clear the internal list.

=item $ar = $grab->finish()

Get an arrayref of all the events, then destroy the grab object.

=item $hub = $grab->hub()

Get the hub that is used by the grab event.

=back

=head1 ENDING BEHAVIOR

By default the hub used has C<no_ending> set to true. This will prevent the hub
from enforcing that you issued a plan and ran at least one test. You can turn
enforcement back one like this:

    $grab->hub->set_no_ending(0);

With C<no_ending> turned off, C<finish> will run the post-test checks to
enforce the plan and that tests were run. In many cases this will result in
additional events in your events array.
