=head1 NAME

Test2::Workflow - A test workflow is a way of structuring tests using
composable units.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A test workflow is a way of structuring tests using composable units. A well
known example of a test workflow is L<RSPEC|http://rspec.info/>. RSPEC is
implemented using Test2::Workflow in L<Test2::Tools::Spec> along with several
extensions.

=head1 IMPORTANT CONCEPTS

=head2 BUILD

L<Test2::Workflow::Build>

A Build is used to compose tasks. Usually a build object is pushed to the stack
before running code that adds tasks to the build. Once the build sub is
complete the build is popped and returned. Usually a build is converted into a
root task or task group.

=head2 RUNNER

L<Test2::Workflow::Runner>

A runner takes the composed tasks and executes them in the proper order.

=head2 TASK

L<Test2::Workflow::Task>

A task is a unit of work to accomplish. There are 2 main types of task.

=head3 ACTION

An action is the most simple unit used in composition. An action is essentially
a name and a codeblock to run.

=head3 GROUP

A group is a task that is composed of other tasks.

=head1 EXPORTS

All exports are optional, you must request the ones you want.

=item $parsed = parse_args(args => \@args)

=item $parsed = parse_args(args => \@args, level => $L)

=item $parsed = parse_args(args => \@args, caller => [caller($L)])

This will parse a "typical" task builders arguments. The C<@args> array MUST
contain a name (plain scalar containing text) and also a single CODE reference.
The C<@args> array MAY also contain any quantity of line numbers or hashrefs.
The resulting data structure will be a single hashref with all the provided
hashrefs squashed together, and the 'name', 'code', 'lines' and 'frame' keys
set from other arguments.

    {
        # All hashrefs from @args get squashed together:
        %squashed_input_hashref_data,

        # @args must have exactly 1 plaintext scalar that is not a number, it
        # is considered the name:
        name => 'name from input args'

        # Integer values are treated as line numbers
        lines => [ 35, 44 ],

        # Exactly 1 coderef must be provided in @args:
        code => \&some_code,

        # 'frame' contains the 'caller' data. This may be passed in directly,
        # obtained from the 'level' parameter, or automatically deduced.
        frame => ['A::Package', 'a_file.pm', 42, ...],
    }

=item $build = init_root($pkg, %args)

This will initialize (or return the existing) a build for the specified
package. C<%args> get passed into the L<Test2::Workflow::Build> constructor.
This uses the following defaults (which can be overridden using C<%args>):

    name    => $pkg,
    flat    => 1,
    iso     => 0,
    async   => 0,
    is_root => 1,

Note that C<%args> is completely ignored if the package build has already been
initialized.

=item $build = root_build($pkg)

This will return the root build for the specified package.

=item $build = current_build()

This will return the build currently at the top of the build stack (or undef).

=item $build = build($name, \%params, sub { ... })

This will push a new build object onto the build stash then run the provided
codeblock. Once the codeblock has finished running the build will be popped off
the stack and returned.

See C<parse_args()> for details about argument processing.
