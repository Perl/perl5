=head1 NAME

Test2::Manual::Tooling::Plugin::ToolCompletes - How to add behaviors that occur
when a tool completes work.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This tutorial helps you understand how to add behaviors that occur when a tool
is done with its work. All tools need to acquire and then release a context,
for this tutorial we make use of the release hooks that are called every time a
tool releases the context object.

=head1 COMPLETE CODE UP FRONT

    package Test2::Plugin::MyPlugin;

    use Test2::API qw{test2_add_callback_context_release};

    sub import {
        my $class = shift;

        test2_add_callback_context_release(sub {
            my $ctx_ref = shift;

            print "Context was released\n";
        });
    }
