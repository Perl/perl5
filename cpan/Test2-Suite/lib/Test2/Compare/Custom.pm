=head1 NAME

Test2::Compare::Custom - Custom field check for comparisons.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sometimes you want to do something complicated or unusual when validating a
field nested inside a deep data structure. You could pull it out of the
structure and test it separately, or you can use this to embed the check. This
provides a way for you to write custom checks for fields in deep comparisons.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $cus = Test2::Compare::Custom->new(
        name => 'IsRef',
        operator => 'ref(...)',
        stringify_got => 1,
        code => sub {
            my %args = @_;
            return $args{got} ? 1 : 0;
        },
    );

    # Pass
    is(
        { a => 1, ref => {},   b => 2 },
        { a => 1, ref => $cus, b => 2 },
        "This will pass"
    );

    # Fail
    is(
        {a => 1, ref => 'notref', b => 2},
        {a => 1, ref => $cus,     b => 2},
        "This will fail"
    );

=head1 ARGUMENTS

Your custom sub will be passed 4 arguments in a hash:

    code => sub {
        my %args = @_;
        # provides got, exists, operator, name
        return ref($args{got}) ? 1 : 0;
    },

C<$_> is also localized to C<got> to make it easier for those who need to use
regexes.

=over 4

=item got

=item $_

The value to be checked.

=item exists

This will be a boolean. This will be true if C<got> exists at all. If
C<exists> is false then it means C<got> is not simply undef, but doesn't
exist at all (think checking the value of a hash key that does not exist).

=item operator

The operator specified at construction.

=item name

The name provided at construction.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item $code = $cus->code

Returns the coderef provided at construction.

=item $name = $cus->name

Returns the name provided at construction.

=item $op = $cus->operator

Returns the operator provided at construction.

=item $stringify = $cus->stringify_got

Returns the stringify_got flag provided at construction.

=item $bool = $cus->verify(got => $got, exists => $bool)
