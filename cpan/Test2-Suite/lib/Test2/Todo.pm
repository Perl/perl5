=head1 NAME

Test2::Todo - TODO extension for Test2.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an object that lets you create and manage TODO states for tests. This
is an extension, not a plugin or a tool. This library can be used by plugins
and tools to manage todo states.

If you simply want to write a todo test then you should look at the C<todo>
function provided by L<Test2::Tools::Basic>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test2::Todo;

    # Start the todo
    my $todo = Test2::Todo->new(reason => 'Fix later');

    # Will be considered todo, so suite still passes
    ok(0, "oops");

    # End the todo
    $todo->end;

    # TODO has ended, this test will actually fail.
    ok(0, "oops");

=head1 CONSTRUCTION OPTIONS

=over 4

=item reason (required)

The reason for the todo, this can be any defined value.

=item hub (optional)

The hub to which the TODO state should be applied. If none is provided then the
current global hub is used.

=back

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item $todo->end

End the todo state.

=back

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item $count = Test2::Todo->hub_in_todo($hub)

If the hub has any todo objects this will return the total number of them. If
the hub has no todo objects it will return 0.

=back

=head1 OTHER NOTES

=head2 How it works

When an instance is created a filter sub is added to the L<Test2::Hub>. This
filter will set the C<todo> and C<diag_todo> attributes on all events as they
come in. When the instance is destroyed, or C<end()> is called, the filter is
removed.

When a new hub is pushed (such as when a subtest is started) the new hub will
inherit the filter, but it will only set C<diag_todo>, it will not set C<todo>
on events in child hubs.

=head2 $todo->end is called at destruction

If your C<$todo> object falls out of scope and gets garbage collected, the todo
will end.

=head2 Can I use multiple instances?

Yes. The most recently created one that is still active will win.
