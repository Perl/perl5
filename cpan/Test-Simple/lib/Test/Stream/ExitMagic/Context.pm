=head1 NAME

Test::Stream::ExitMagic::Context - Special context for use in an END block.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Test::Stream> needs to accomplish some magic in an END block. In an END block
it is not always possible to have a true/complete context object, so this
trivial one is used instead.

B<DO NOT USE THIS>. If you find yourself thinking that you should use this then
B<STOP!> because you are very likely to be wrong.
